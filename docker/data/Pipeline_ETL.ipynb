       "  'comment': \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a planet eater out for a stone that will allow him to travel throughout space and time to find planets to consume. The ancient animal transformers protect the stone and have traveled to Earth to hide themselves and the stone. When autobots that support the planet eater arrive on Earth to find the stone the transformers and animal transformers will need to work together to protect the stone.This movie is directed by Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II) and stars Anthony Ramos (In the Heights), Dominique Fishback (Judas and the Black Messiah), Dean Scott Vazquez (In the Heights), Tobe Nwigwe (Mo) and Michael Kelly (Dawn of the Dead).This storyline was really compelling and interesting. It was tremendous watching the animal and car transformer worlds combine. The CGI and special effects were outstanding and every action scene is a 10/10. I really adored every fight. However, we didn't need the humans in this at all, and the action, dialogue and plot points involving Ramos and Fishback were painful. They are good actors whose performances weren't good here and felt out of place. It's time to move on from the humans needing to be the heroes in these storylines...because the Transformers, both good guys and bad guys, were awesome.Overall, this is a worthwhile addition to the Transformers series that I would strongly recommend. I would score this a 6/10.\",\n",

It is unfortunately a rather drab affair.Within about 5 minutes every cliche possible is ticked off the list. The dialogue is grating and so corny it hurts. The action is messy and disorienting. The newly introduced 'Maximals' are severely wasted with limited screen time. The plot centres around a silly doohickey that is hard to care about. The human characters are kind of annoying and poorly written. None of the humour really lands and neither do any of the emotional story beats. The story sags a little in the middle. I could go on.Saying all that, this film is mildly entertaining and does have its moments, although they are too few and far between. I guess it's worth watching if you are into your Transformers films, but the casual movie goer should probably save their money and skip this one.\",\n",

Wraps up with an \"uh ok?\" And the random post-credits scene which was not actually post-credits. Seems director over here figured nobody gave enough a crap to stay past the credits for one.So formulaic. From the girls plot armor to the now typecast optimus prime. Also too much filler. Of all the films. This one had like ZERO reason to be longer than 1hr 30mins. Seriously dumb.Only exception was noah and the kid. Noth were decent. But the girl and the one dimensional transformers? Apart from mirage..The jumpscare devilbotthingies were so annoying..too much filler. Is this a horror flick yet?Why is the transformers villains teeth so rusty? Someone of his leadership and caliber is not going to rock some homeless teeth. Hes either going to have perfect optimus teeth or none. Totally took me out of his perfectly delivered lines.Some of the cgi is just bad. A lot of it.I will rewatch at my own pace just to slam it more.',\n",

Sadly, I guess it could work but man, how lazy.I guess it might work for teenage boys filled with testosterone, can't really se who else this is marketed to.\",\n",

The 2 (unknown) leading actors for sure arent terrible, but they sure as heck arent able to carry this movie by themselves either. Bummer.More bad: what about the thrill and spectactle? This movie is severely lacking in real thrill and spark! I mean after 30 minutes I already got bored watching this movie. And getting bored is the last thing I desire when watching an action movie for petes sake!Not any good then? It'll do for the masses, but be sure to bring along a lot of popcorn though, because any junkfood you will eat, will guaranteed give you more satisfaction than watching this mediocre franchise edition.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"I appreciated the fact that this film made Optimus Prime an actual character, and that it found a couple of interesting, believable ways to give the human characters a legitimate use in the story.Aside from a few moments involving these things, I was bored senseless by this movie.I struggle to comprehend how a script like this passes so many hands and makes it to production; it has some of the worst dialogue this side of Attack of the Clones.Everything in this movie is told to us, rather than creatively shown. It's obnoxious, it's lazy, and it's stupid. It treats us, the audience, like we're stupid as it spoon feeds every piece of information to us like we're infants, even though the story is really simple and nothing original or complex happens once.All this could be saved if the action were entertaining and investing. But it isn't, aside from a handful of stylish shots.Say what you will about Michael Bay's movies. (They're bad.) But at least they had huge scale to them and the stakes were understood.This is a bland blockbuster movie, through and through. The action never features any destruction or threat to human life. There isn't a practical, real thing happening on screen.Artificial, boring, and derivative, with about 5-10 minutes worth of good material.I thought Bumblebee was a bright spot, but it looks like the good streak has been cut short.\",\n",

       "  'comment': '\"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" is the new movie based on the Takara toys that Hasbro exploited and have been brought to television, movies and comics. In this new film, the result is kind of almost bad, a soulless and simple script that could have been told in 90 minutes and not in an excessive length of 127 minutes that become slow. The performances are ordinary and the director\\'s work does not stand out. The production is not used, the soundtrack has no essence and the cinematography is quite conventional. The biggest negative point is the costume design and the setting, since the film takes place during 1994 and fails to take us to that year, with the exception of some retro objects and extras that wear 90s costumes, the protagonists really look very 2020\\'s. Another flaw is the digital special effects that fail to be entirely realistic, the green screen and After Effects giving themselves away for much of the length of the film. A totally forgettable production.',\n",

I was kind of excited at the opening screen to see a certain character from back in the day. But it ends up as just a big fight over a \"thing\", with no depth, making it a big snooze-fest. I found it really hard to pay attention after a while. Even the action started to get a bit repetitive and predictable.Also, sadly, this movie is obviously someone\\'s attempt at a commentary on racial inequity. It\\'s an important issue, yes. But out of place in a Transformers movie. The character development at the beginning of the movie starts off with decent introductions of the underdogs. Then at some point, it\\'s suddenly laced with racial undertones in all directions... cliche stereotypes, and insulting caricatures. But not only is it out of place, bring some this way makes it a step backwards in terms of efforts to reduce this sort of divisive crap in entertainment. Now little kids of all backgrounds will see this and think it\\'s how things really are, and stereotypes will be perpetuated. Disappointing.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Rise of the Beasts has a lot of potential going for it, but unfortunately, very little to none of it is realized.This film suffers from a poor script, characters I couldn't care for, and it left me wanting. I must admit, though, this film looked surprisingly good in 3D.Overall this film is very forgettable and doesn't do anything new. Also, with an ending that leaves me with more questions and thoughts of why, then necessary really brings everything down.Suffice it to say I still prefer Michael Bays Transformers. They're better, in my opinion. (I said it, deal with it)PS. As the movie drew to a close, one audience member gave a loud clap. I immediately thought well I'm glad someone here enjoyed this film.IMDb: 3/10\\nLetterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Well, it's about robots from outer space so just turn your brain off for maximum enjoyment. If you told me the script was AI-generated, I'd believe it.But is it entertaining? Depends on your definition. If you want to see robots and humans hunting\\nMacGuffins, clashing and brawling for their respective fates, painfully cringe dialog and jokes, and a predictable plot? Then yes, it's entertaining.I'm a sucker for 90s hip-hop, so hearing Tribe and Wu-Tang was a pleasant surprise. I also appreciate the dynamic lighting and how the robots are integrated into their environments. They don't stick out too much or look odd.Until they talk. Then most of the immersion goes right out the window. Nearly every robot-spoken word is delivered with the gusto of the movie trailer voiceover guy bellowing cliches like ancient creeds.And yet, as the 3rd act progressed I found myself starting to be won over, almost like a case of Stockholm Syndrome. Maybe because I stopped thinking about it. Maybe the movie itself became a visual lobotomy.I almost want to recommend this. Not because it's good, but because it's bad in ways that are endearing and sort of fun.\",\n",

WRONG!Generic storyline, dull dialogue, even the effects felt so devoid of any coolness, man back in 2007 transformations were SICK! Now its just some flexible metal mumbo jumbo, whatever costs less I figure.I really tried to enjoy it but I could not, I didn't to expect to dislike it sthis much, I guess in some way it's a cool for kids; YAY ROBOTS! Big monke robot punches the bad guy, the gud guys run, oh no! We have to stop big bad guy.The soundtrack is mid, oh and the way the story develops and the decisionmaking of the characters is pretty absurd.It might've just ruined transformers for me.Don't bother, go watch Spiderverse or Guardians of the galaxy 3 instead.Like, not even if you're a Transformers fan, matter of fact if you want to stay a Transformers fan definitely skip it.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'After being disappointed with Age of Extinction, loathing The Last Knight, and being one of the few that disliked Bumblebee, I went into this movie expecting it to be terrible. But I am ecstatic after watching the best Transformers movie since Dark of the Moon.I found myself smiling for most of the runtime. For the first time in years, I kept thinking \"Transformers are so damn cool.\" There are so many beautiful shots with these CGI creations, so many moments to screenshot and frame. The action is miles better than the last three entries.They fixed so many of the issues that plagued the last three movies. There are actual characters with motivations we understand, conflicts where we can see both sides of the argument. Even the Transformer characters are significantly more fleshed out. I felt for them.There is an actual story instead of nonsense to move the plot forward. You don\\'t even have to turn your brain off to enjoy it. And the comedy actually works! I laughed more times than the previous three movies combined.This experience made me so happy, and I look forward to any future projects if this is the direction they\\'re taking. It\\'s a perfect example of how, if you do it right and create with care and passion, the result will be endlessly better.EDIT: I loved it even more the second time. Multiple action sequences give me goosebumps, similar to how I feel when watching the Dark of the Moon highway scene and the Optimus rage scene at the end. And I can\\'t believe I didn\\'t mention it originally, but the musical score is AMAZING. It elevates every scene and gives me the feels.(3 viewings, early fan screening UltraScreen 6/7/2023, UltraScreen 6/14/2023, SuperScreen 7/3/2023)',\n",

Aslo Scourage killed the ape easily in the beginning and beat Prime eaisly in their first fight but the last fight, Prime killed him pretty easily? WTF? They just threw in the Beasts for no reason.

Unless it is the first fifteen minutes or the last fifteen minutes, you are not going to miss anything. This director has no track record and had no business directing this film. You do not hand the reins over to a nobody on the 7th film in a series. Terrible job little bro. Anthony Ramos and Dean Scott Vasquez did a stupendous job. Who the hell cast Dominique Fishback??? Is she some 1990's afternoon Disney castoff. She couldn't pull off an episode of Zach and Cody, let alone a triple A summer release. It was painful to watch her acting. There are no big actors in the film at all except a short stint with Luna Lauren Velez as the mother figure. It's obvious paramount pictures did not even care about the release of this film and it was handed off to a bunch of castoffs. And the so called humor fell from a cliff flat on it's face. I didn't hear a single chuckle in a packed theater during a 2 hour film. This is not a box office smash...go watch the Spiderverse and get your money's worth!\",\n",

Also, having this take place in 1994 was when I was right out of high school and wanted to reminisce about those days.Seeing Optimus Prime always gave me a sense of courage. Because his belief in saving worlds went above and beyond what was required. A hero in many ways.This story attempts to shoehorn the cartoon movie which the Autobots are trying to find a way home.Unfortunately, the story centers around a Hispanic post-teen dude who has one of the most obnoxious Brooklyn accent, it\\'s hard to not root for his end. But, of course, they have to paint him to be the victim of society. Hard to believe they think he was a former solider. What the script fails miserably at, is that having courage doesn\\'t mean you take revenge on the world by attempting to steal a fancy Porche 911.It wants you to like New Yorkers. But the rest of the country hates them. They\\'re loudmouths who continue to be prideful and self-righteous entitled elitist who think middle America are behind in the times. Meanwhile, embraces self-destruction. Urban animals. If you are the minority who likes them, this movie is for you. It peppers itself with the typical tropes of city pride (\"Brooklyn!\") and wants you to do the same because it shows you the Twin Towers. Ugh. Millenials won\\'t understand. Nor care.The worst part of this flick is that you pair this guy up with an equally obnoxious Pete Davidson as Mirage (wasn\\'t this Jazz in the 80\\'s?). His quips are cringey. It\\'s that guy who thinks he\\'s the funniest dude in the room.So the story is of a key that opens time portals for a planet eater Omnicron (from the 80\\'s movie) to come to Earth to devour it. Why? Who knows. Because it\\'s there? It doesn\\'t gather much more energy from it that any other planet in the universe would have. So the stakes are hilariously massive. But that doesn\\'t stop that New Yorker from trying to save this planet because...? His brother has sickle cell? Oof. Weak.What made the movie \"Bumblebee\" great is the innocence of the human characters. These \"street wise\" guys are annoying. So getting past that was a chore.With all the technology I saw being spun around in this flick, why can\\'t they just re-make the 80\\'s cartoon into a live action movie? BTW, the Spike suit makes an appearance here.Middling movie with nowhere to go.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts combines the character focused approach of Bumblebee with the bombast of the previous Bay films for a great globe trotting adventure that wastes no time and strikes a much better balance in screen time given to its human and Transformers characters, even if the beasts themselves are actually surprisingly underutilized.Anthony Ramos gives a really good lead performance, he's easy to root for and has genuinely strong relationships with Optimus Prime and Mirage. Mirage is the standout with Pete Davidson voicing the character, the constant quips never get annoying and he still has an emotional connection to Noah as well.Peter Cullen is always perfect as Optimus Prime and this is undoubtedly some of his best work in the live action films. Its what Bay was going for in his later installments but done better, an Optimus Prime who's not the ideal leader but a selfish, broken one carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.Steven Caple Jr.'s direction is strong overall, the fights can get a little chaotic but a second act chase and third act final battle are still a lot of fun. The music by Jongnic Bontemps wisely chooses to lay off the nostalgia for the most part, creating its own epic score and using classic pieces sparingly.The soundtrack does a good job making it easy to adjust to the time jump and making it feel authentic and the CG is impressive overall. There's obviously a few weak spots throughout but it's still maintains that balance between realistic details and more animated flourishes.\",\n",

I guess), the long distance build up for the re-introduction of Optimus Primal that are too long making it his appearance can be said not too much in the movie, and the exact problem from previous movies happening again, which is when they make Optimus Prime takes too much L, the way they make Optimus so weak neither in the beginning or in the middle while they always hailed him as the most powerful one and the legend and the leader of all Autobots kinda of pissed me off, that's basically most of my problem with the movie, while the goods of Rise Of The Beasts is of course the action, the battle scene are pretty exciting and the last battle was great, Anthony Ramos ok performance and characters itself overall is a W, all of the Autobots and the Maximals team were fine, Optimus got a lot of screen time, Noah's little brother and friend performance was fine, some cool and even funny scene, liked some of the soundtrack, and Scourge was a good villain, overall Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is problematic and have a lot of flaws but it also still fills with entertaining action, villain, ok performance male lead, and not ridiculous main plot, it's not terrible but it's not amazing or incredible either, (the half plus score i gave for the movie is because Rise Of The Beasts have more stuff in it than the Bumblebee movie and that's why i am not giving it the same score which is only a 6 for Bumblebee).\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is a captivating film that blends comedy, action, adventure and drama. As a young film watcher, I was thoroughly impressed by the movie\\'s ability to keep me entertained. One of the standout performances in the film is Mirage (Pete Davidson), who brings a delightful touch of comedy and showcases a genuine heart for humans.The idea of the story revolves around the Maximals joining forces with Noah, (Anthony Ramos) and the Autobots as they work together to defeat the menacing Scourge (Peter Dinklage) and the Terrorcons in a battle that could potentially be the fate of the world.Although the film takes a bit of time to build up in certain parts, it ultimately contributes to the overall experience. The camera work is flawless, providing a fresh and new perspective for viewers. Anthony Ramos delivers an outstanding performance as Noah Diaz, effectively portraying a range of emotions and going above and beyond to embody the character. Peter Cullen, the voice of the heroic Autobot Optimus Prime, presents a new side of Prime that we have never seen before, adding depth to the character. Peter Dinklage takes on the role of the perfect villain Scourge, adding a scary, creepy and dark twist to the story-a crucial element that superhero movies often need.The message of \"never quit and keep getting back on your feet\" resonates strongly throughout the narrative. It\\'s important to note that the film contains a significant amount of profanity.I give Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts a solid rating of 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, as well as adults who appreciate the Transformers franchise.

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is one of those many examples that raise one question: where are the talents and the creative people these days? Certainly not too many are involved in the movie business - Rise of the Beasts got nothing that will raise it above the bar of barely acceptable: a dead boring story line, dead boring characters, and terrible dialogues we listened to one million times before. The special effects are somewhat okay, but, well, that's pretty standard these days.

       "  'comment': 'The Transformers movies have always been more popcorn flick than anything. Huge Michael Bay explosions, some one liners and eye candy for the human actors/actresses. That being said, the last few movies haven\\'t really had many memorable moments. Rise of the Beasts is no exception to that.The soundtrack is straight 90s rap which makes complete sense seeing as the movie is set in 1994. The tracks work well with the segments of the movie they\\'re featured in, especially one particular moment of LL Cool J\\'s \"knock you out\"The cgi was pretty decent. I didn\\'t really notice any flaws like I have with more recent movies like Fast 10 but that\\'s to be expected with a highly CGI dependent movie.The acting left a lot to be desired from the human characters. The eye candy didn\\'t exist this time around but I imagine that was done for a reason. The problem is I didn\\'t care for either of the human protagonists. I felt more connection to the younger brother of the male lead than I did the lead.The Transformers are as entertaining as always and that should be the main draw of the movie. Bumblebee being sidelined for 90% of the film left room for Mirage to take the stage. There were a few good one liners from him but then they take him away at the climax to put on their own Ironman suit which quite honestly took away from the movie a bit.Unicorn was supposed to be the big threat here but never felt threatening at all. Instead you get the 3 henchmen who were dominating the autobots early on yet in the main fight are easily disposed of.Overall it was a good watch yet nothing memorable. A few good laughs in a mostly empty theater.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Rise of the Beasts opens with Noah who struggles to find a decent job to support his family and Elena who works in a museum and is interested in researching artifacts. But oh my, we couldn't care less about them. They really spent almost 30 minutes on their stories which as you can guess, are very bland and dull. Noah's story might seem relatable for some people as we're in a tough economy now but audience doesn't want you talking about finding a job. This ain't for the Oscar. And Elena barely has any story. We don't even know who she is. No really. Who is she? 😅😭They could cut to the chase and skip some of the parts in the first act. It becomes worse when there's no comedy, everything is just so serious. A total opposite of Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeouf) and Mikaela's (Megan Fox) where comedy was top-notch and the plot was simple and fun. Even Sam's parents were comical. We're not exactly sure why they chose the serious road this time around, but we prefer Sam Witwicky's world.On the other hand, the robots have better chemistry and a better story to tell. Mirage, voiced by Pete Davidson is goofy af. For the first time ever, we can tolerate with Pete Davidson. And we might even like him now. Bumblebee is Bumblebee, we all know we love him. Arcee is very acrobatic, she's the eye candy and yes, she can also fight. But the common thing that stands out is they actually have a soul. We feel close to them, we can relate to them, they are not JUST robots. They are living beings. And somehow, we care about them more than what Transformers 4 & 5 can offer to us.Without a doubt, there are plenty of actions from beginning until the end. You don't have to worry about that. But the question is, 'Are there good?' We could say you'll be entertained. But goshhhh, we miss Michael Bay so much so that this movie tries to do what Bay did but it doesn't work. Bay's skills and talents put him as the master of action scenes and we know that. His directorial left a big mark and we're dying to see something that is at least, on par with what Bay did. But what we saw something in the middle. They couldn't achieve the bar that Bay had set but it wasn't disappointing either. It is still entertaining.Entertaining being that this movie is action-packed especially when the middle part starts to kick in. Fun fact that it has more action than Fast X or Guardians of the Galaxy. You know when Bay did his Transformers films, there were plenty of WOW/WOAH moments (we are referring to the first three) because Bay included slow-mos that looked very cool, upbeat music that synced with the choreography, customized sound-design explosions that only he could pull off amongst many other elements. Rise of the Beasts has its WOW/WOAH moments as well (not as many) but it felt short compared to Bay's. Slow-mos were almost non-existent, music was okay at best but doesn't help with the action and explosions are explosions, nothing unique or refreshing.However, thanks to its choreography, they are able to create some truly WOW moments that will literally WOW you. Some of the stunts have been done many times before but we're pleased to see they are able to create a few action stunts that are purely amazing.Let's talk about tracking shots. This film does use this technique a few times where the cameras follow the characters from behind and it creates this sense of POV that we love coming from a sci-fi robot film. This may be a nitpicky thing and it deals with our preference, but this film could be so much better if they have more tracking shots especially with the two leads, Noah and Elena running for survival or on Arcee, the superbiker. But we really applause the use of tracking shots, just beautiful.There was a subplot/twist in Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen that apparently this film borrows and uses it almost quite the same way. Now this depends entirely on your opinion, being that it is rehashed, on whether you like it or not. If you're asking us, we have a mixed feeling because it seems super duper predictable, like we KNOW where it's headed.You know in every Transformers movie, Optimus Prime would give his closing speech and the credits roll as it ends? Well, this film offers a surprise. It is quite different than all the previous films. And what even surprise us is that the ending got us good. Real good. You won't know what's coming. And if there's a sequel, we don't know how they're gonna make it happen. The ending is worth watching this in cinemas.Verdict: Incredibly better than Transformers 4 & 5, Rise of the Beasts offers itself to be quite entertaining with above-average action sequences and some genuinely WOW moments, thanks to its choreography and tracking shots. However, the uninteresting human drama and lack of comedy make this a subpar entry compared to the first three Transformers films.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'SCORE: 9.2/10Now that\\'s what I call a revival. That was far and above the best Transformers movie made to date, and apparently this is the first film in a trilogy that is to come. This has me excited! They decided to finally pair the awesomeness that is the Transformers with a good story. I don\\'t know why, but Pete Davidson as Mirage just works. He adds a new flavor to the franchise that felt much needed, and his comedic relief was well executed. The Maximals are some of the coolest Transformers we\\'ve ever seen and the relationship and connection between Optimus Primal and Optimus Prime was great. The villain for this movie was a cross between Thanos, Darkseid, and Ultron, and he wasn\\'t just some scrub without a plan. All of the new pieces added to the franchise were spectacular, but this film really thrives because of the OGs.Optimus Prime and Bumblebee shine bright in this one. In fact, Bumblebee gets to utter a phrase that is in my top tier of best movie lines ever spoken. I thought I wasn\\'t hearing it correctly, but he really said, right before he deactivates, \"O Captain! My Captain!\". His rebirth and return to the battlefield was a major highlight of the film, but nothing tops Optimus Prime ripping Scourge\\'s head off and Arrival to Earth playing as they escape. That was a little something for the people who had to suffer through the absolute garbage that was most of the Transformers franchise, but still love parts of it. New beginnings!The one thing I couldn\\'t get behind was the character of Elena. I don\\'t know if it was the writing or the acting or a little bit of both, but her character felt so out of place. Anthony Ramos\\' performance was almost watered down because of his lack of chemistry where her and the noticeable drop off in acting when it cut to Elena. Other than that, this far exceeds all expectations.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Transformers is all about it's CGI, Action pieces and the emotions between the autobots and humans. And this movie has done that perfectly well. I would say it's not great as Michael Bay 1st transformers movie but it's not that bad at all. Action & CGI is terrific in this film. Specially the beast that has shown in the film was executed perfectly well. Background score justifies the film with proper sound effects whenever the action is going on. Story is just average as every transformers movie has and director should've worked on human characters to build-up their arcs because in some scenes they are just added without any reason. Human characters aren't build properly as they should. In some scenes human characters are forced just to keep for screen presence and conversation which is just average to watch. Autobots & Beast transformation is superb and whenever they comes on screen and transform it's just amazing to watch and specially the climax sequence where the fights between Autobots & Unicorn is just OUTSTANDING to watch. Direction & Screenplay is good nothing stretched and feels bored movie runs in a same pace and it'll hooked you up till the last. There is a scope for the sequels as director has given many hints in the end let's see what they have in stored for us in near future. All n all if you have watched previous transformers films watch this film you won't be disappointed and specially the action sequences are amazing...\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it\\'s the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That\\'s not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they\\'ve finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me ball. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket\\'s traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: \"There is no God, that\\'s why I took his place.\" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can\\'t stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I\\'m glad she didn\\'t kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I\\'m surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It\\'s time to add another one to that list. \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like \"filler episodes\" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, \"Guardians 3\" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since \"Avengers: Endgame\". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians\\' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax\\nBest Quote: \"She is to us.\"\\nBest Scene: Infiltrating Orgocorp\\nBest Piece of Score: \"I Love You Guys\"',\n",

       "  'comment': '\"There is no God. That\\'s why I stepped in.\" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there\\'s no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that\\'s saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it\\'s a shame to see him move on (but I\\'m looking forward to seeing what he\\'ll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That\\'s a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He\\'s capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU\\'s best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Firstly Adam warlock\\'s intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang\\'s depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It\\'s lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don\\'t recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he\\'s portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he\\'s in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we\\'ll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis\\'s role in it, like \"oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario\" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it\\'s one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that\\'s a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn\\'t expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it\\'d be another case of superhero burnout. It\\'s sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them. Oh and I forgot to mention it\\'s pretty funny.',\n",

But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.\",\n",

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel. Trust me this is a great film.\",\n",

As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.\",\n",

James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie! Loved it to bits!\",\n",

However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel\\'s \"GOTG Vol. 3\" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket\\'s origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, \"Guardians\" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel\\'s invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" and to a lesser extent the \"Black Panther\" sequel. Give Gunn credit for bidding a loving farewell with both barrels blazing, even if it does close the books on this series, at least temporarily.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be \"family fare\", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition\\'s sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that\\'s left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I \"heart\" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.\",\n",

       "  'comment': '\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians\\' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora\\'s (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).\"The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.\"The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians\\' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she\\'s in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D\\'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn\\'s vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there\\'s a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he\\'s pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn\\'t just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to \"Creep\" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket\\'s origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" is most appealing when it defies a \"product over art\" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It\\'s thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they\\'re taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There\\'s a version of \"Vol. 3\" that\\'s even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn\\'s personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don\\'t just sing along to a well-known tune like \"Creep\"; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of \"Vol. 3\" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn\\'s personality intact.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.\",\n",

It's a beautifully written film with so much great action sequences, comedic scenes & some really heart touching moments. The backstory for Rocket really messes you up seeing what he went through & how he had to witness all his friends being slaughtered. Although it makes you believe it at times thankfully none of the Guardians actually pass but they do split in an emotional finale. Star-Lord finally decides to stop running & returns home to Earth to see his grand father! The final dance scene was so enjoyable. There are two post credit scenes so make sure to say to the end!\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'SCORE: 10/10James Gunn...you beautiful, beautiful man. Thank you. You inspire me to want to act, you inspire me to want to write and direct, and you inspire me to embrace my creativity and the artist within me. My eyes were glued to the IMAX screen from start to finish, even after having watched the entirety of the first 2 movies as part of a Guardians Marathon in theaters. The stakes were unbelievably high and they just kept increasing in severity. Right off rip we are thrust into a life threatening circumstance with the arrival of Adam Warlock and Rocket\\'s imminent death. Peter is seen drowning his sadness of losing Gamora with alcohol, a parallel to how his buddy Thor was handling his awful life situation. Things were not looking good for the Guardians at all.On top of all of that, quite possibly the MCU\\'s most ruthless, hate-able villain was about to be introduced. If you had any plan of withholding tears during the movie, bring the box of tissues. You\\'re going to need it. Through exploring Rocket\\'s past, we are exposed to how awful he and the other animals were treated during the High Evolutionary\\'s dangerous experiments. We have to sit there and watch all of Rocket\\'s friends, Lylla, Teefs, and Floor be gunned down right in front of him as he attempts to break them out. Everything from hearing his younger voice to seeing him as a baby set the perfect stage for emotional connection to one of the Guardians\\' most important members.How did they manage to make the rating for this movie PG-13? They did abide by the 1 F-word rule, but the violence was intensely gruesome, which I loved. Heads being chopped off, faces being ripped off, and action sequences that were some of the best the MCU has ever seen. With how some projects have been leaning into the \"Marvel fatigue\" that people talk about, this film is by far one of the most ambitious with its choices. It dares to be different, but also gives us that true Guardians of the Galaxy vibe that we all love, something that Quantumania failed to do.The one small thing that I will say that bothered me was Gamora\\'s character and how I wish they would\\'ve gone just a little bit further with some of the emotional moments. Gamora stopping to tell Peter that she \"bets they were fun\" had me about to be a complete wreck, but then it felt like they took the foot off that gas. She stays stubborn til the end, which I can respect, but maybe just had wishfully thinking that she would come around. I\\'m just happy that no one of great significance dies, and that the LEGENDARY STAR LORD WILL RETURN! One of my favorite characters in the MCU for sure. Thank you James Gunn.Amendment: My score needs an amendment. This was a perfect movie. Better than the original Guardians? I\\'m at least open to that idea, but for now I\\'m going to say no. The way they used Gamora\\'s character grew on me and her \"I bet we were fun\" successfully broke me. They handled her character arc so meticulously and, as I said in my original review, maybe it was just wishful thinking that they would\\'ve had her come around fully at the end in some way. I think the first time around I was dealing with the fact that it was the 3rd movie of the night of a 7 and 1/2 marathon that ended at 2:30 AM, I was preparing myself for the biggest presentation of my corporate career, and I was still trying to emotionally recover from having to experience Yondu\\'s death again.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"I think it's fair to say that since Endgame Marvel's output has been littered with as many misses as hits. After the thoroughly disappointing Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and James Gunn well and truly delivers with Guardians Vol. 3.This is easily the most fun I've had with a superhero film in a long time. It is funny, thrilling, and surprisingly emotional. Fans who have been following these characters for the last 10 years, get ready for such a satisfying and emotional journey.What makes the Guardians so good is that they stand out. Superhero films are becoming far too formulaic and blending into one another, but the Guardians films somehow manage to buck this trend. Sure, the story follows the well trodden superhero film structure at its core and there are lots of familiar cliches and tropes, but the dressing around these things feels vibrant, distinct, and cared for.The characters remain unique and interesting, with great performances behind them all. I was particularly impressed with Pom Klementieff in this film, who steals the show in my opinion with her emotion and humour. All of the performances are great though, with another shout out to Chukwudi Iwuji for a captivating performance.The story is full of emotion, and is quite possibly the most emotional and punchy Marvel film yet. It brought me to tears and I could hear plenty of others in the theatre feeling a similar way! It's also really funny too with so many laugh out loud moments. James Gunn excelled himself with this script in every way.Saying that, I do think some story elements feel a little bit clunky, and some characters are a little surplus to requirements, but these are minor criticisms in the grand scheme of things.The action sequences are well done. They aren't mind blowing, but much more emphasis is put into story and character than action so this isn't necessarily a bad thing.I will also say that despite being two and a half hours this film doesn't feel long at all. It never once drags and every scene feels needed and adds something to the whole picture.Guardians Vol 3. Is fun, emotional, and just a joy to watch. A brilliant return to form for the MCU.\",\n",

Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn\\'t love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the \"Best MCU film\"... \"10/10\" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:\\nThe acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:\\nAdam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy\\'s boy whose \"strength \" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He\\'s weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn\\'s humour destroys every tense scene, there\\'s far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she\\'s \\'bleeding\\' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket \"dies\" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don\\'t misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'I am disappointed. Although Guardians 3 is not a bad movie per se, it is definetly the worst of the three.All the sillyness and light hearted jokes of the first two installments seemed just forced: The characters used to argue a lot in the previous movies too, but here the arguments seem more serious and sometimes the friendship actually looks damaged. Rocket gets the spotlight, but most of the background story is simply too dark. I wanted to watch the movie with my kids, but this is not a kids movie. The first two were kind of violent too, but not in this grim, dark and desperate way.Nebula does not seem to fit in the crew, Drax does not do much at all, Groot seems strangely hallow and \\'unfinished\\', only Starlord and Gomorra have a somewhat interesting tension. Both the adult groot and baby groot from 1 and 2 had something going on, young Groot here seems to lack any personality. The writers did not know how to use this character. The actors sometimes played as if it was the last day before summer vacation - just get it done and forget about it.I always liked the family and friendship aspect of the first two, because it was somewhat ridiculed by the characters themselfs (\"5 idiots standing in a circle\" from the first, or \"that unsaid thing\" between Gomorra and Starlord or Drax being gentle to Baby-Groot at the end of part 2), but here it\\'s not embedded in the actions anymore. It has to be said, over and over again.For a Grand Finale it often feels too complex, too empty and too forced. Was it a bad movie - no, probably not, but it was for sure not up there with the other two. I will probably re-watch it in a couple of years, hopefully I like it more then. (\"Endgame\" also grew on me, so there is hope.)It also sucks that there are so many fake ratings on IMDB, some even don\\'t try to hide it.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn\\'t to say it\\'s a terrible film or that some people won\\'t love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney\\'s continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you\\'ll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it\\'s arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket\\'s backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers\\' room constantly asking, \"how can we make this more depressing?\" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it\\'s still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it\\'s the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it\\'s always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn\\'t a bad movie, but it\\'s not a great one either. It\\'s easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of \\'No Way Home\\'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it\\'s a very different beast that what you\\'ve likely come to expect.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"I just got out of The FlashOK. So it does not live up to the positive buzz from the early screenings. It's nowhere near being one of the best comic book movies of all time. It's not even in the conversation for being one of the best DC movies. But I did have a lot of fun with it.A lot may depend on your feelings of Ezra Miller. Younger Barry Allen was really annoying, but I think that's the point. I had no issues with them in the role.The stand out for me, was Michael Keaton. When Batman is doing his things and Danny Elfman's iconic score is booming, it's a joy. But make no mistake this is not Batman 3, it's a Flash movie that features Keaton's Batman.Supergirl was good, I enjoyed her, and if she gets a stand alone, I'd watch it. There were some surprises, that I'm amazed have not leaked.It feels it's run time at times and some of the CGI is very dodgy, especially during a certain moment. Considering what they were going for, I can't believe they released it like that. The CGI at that moment is my biggest complaint.They get away with a lot with its rating including nudity and a fair amount of bad language, including the F bomb.I'm not sure if I'll watch it again, but I had a good time, watching this one time.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Finally after the early screening on 6th June which showed the unfinished print, I get to watch the final cut on IMAX today. One major drawback is that a movie this big has both really good and really bad VFX. Apart from that, this complete fan service aims at not taking the story forward into the DCEU\\'s newly planned future, instead takes Barry Allen on his usual time travel to save his mom and him learning the repercussions of his action, the hard way.This harmless PG-13 movie sticks to the basics and plays safe to the core. Adds a bunch of cameos from DC universe to get us fans riled up. The narrative ranges from meh to \"oh that\\'s fun\" and the director Andy Muschietti hardly fails in hitting the mark. He clearly knows what he intends to do with this script and plays to it\\'s strengths. Ezra Miller indeed is good as The Flash is an added advantage and rest Michael Keaton\\'s return as Batman takes care off.Special mention to all the cameos as they simply were that good. Needless to say, the film is worth watching for them. Sasha Calle\\'s Supergirl has very little to do and she tries to make most of what is offered to her. The visuals during the time travel and the reveal of multiverse was well done. The humor ensures to lighten the tone while keeping the mother-son sentiment intact. Not sure what DCEU\\'s future holds for us fans, The Flash succeeds in entertaining for most of those 2.5hrs.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"No matter how many times you read about how awful this thing looks, trust me when I say it's worse than you're imagining. Some of these visual effects are absolutely abysmal, potentially the worst I've seen in a movie of this scale. It's honestly on the level of 'Son Of The Mask (2005)' or 'The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl 3-D (2005)' at times. Truly, truly terrible stuff. There are some sequences that are more convincing than others, but too many of them are legitimate eye sores. That's not a dig at the visual effects artists, by the way, who were all very likely doing their best with the time they were given and were also very likely underpaid for their work. It's more of a dig at the studio and its odd decision not to grant the VFX houses more time despite the fact that production on this film spanned the entire nine seasons of CW's 'The Flash (2014 - 2023)'.After a bafflingly bad opening movement, the movie does admittedly settle into its own somewhat entertaining rhythm. The second act of 'The Flash (2023)' is surprisingly successful. It isn't great, of course, but it's relatively pacy and features a handful of enjoyable action scenes. The two cameos that are spoilt in the marketing work fairly well, with a certain someone proving he's still got it even after all these years (though the actor in question has been doing good work for his entire career). Ezra Miller turns in far better work then when they played that wizard with the rubbish hair cut, somehow making Barry more irritating than before but also imbuing him with a new semblance of responsibility that ties in nicely to the story's fairy potent emotional underpinning. However, their efforts aren't quite enough to make you forget all the awful things they've done in real life (nothing would be), so there is a strange sort of second-hand guilt that arises from watching them on screen.Where the picture starts to falter once again is in its final third, which starts out modestly enough but eventually escalates into all-out insanity and begins to awkwardly explore the morally iffy side of its multiversal premise. Again, the ugly visuals rear their even uglier heads here and the very fabric of the film itself starts to (admittedly somewhat appropriately) unravel. The frustrating finale reminds you that the movie has been about IP all along, not genuine storytelling, and that any success its second act may have is either accidental or a result of it being the segment that the DC suits meddled with the least during production. Ultimately, the affair's potential is all but entirely stifled by studio-mandated audience pandering and a callously dismissive approach to the importance of a well-considered narrative.Again, some of the picture really isn't all that bad. In fact, it's actually pretty good; I honestly can't say that I didn't enjoy parts of the middle portion. However, it's bookended by some really poor storytelling and contains more than one laughably bad set-piece. The visual effects are sometimes so poor they look like they've been rendered for a cheap PlayStation 3 game. The movie just feels fairly soulless, too.If you want to see a far, far better adaptation of the Flashpoint storyline, just watch 'Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013)' instead.\",\n",

The Flash is, for the most part, an enjoyable film with some really good performances, especially Sasha Calle and Michael Keaton. Not a huge fan of Ezra Miller as the flash, but the biggest issue with the film is undoubtedly the CGI. At times the graphics are poor, other times they are horrendous and unnecessary. The film would have been better had they taken a bit more time with the look of the film. Overall, a decent film with some suprising cameos, some really entertaining moments, but looked cheap.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"I always start any review of a superhero movie by making it clear that these are not my types of movies and my opinion, for any superfans out there, should always be taken with a grain of salt. Now with that in mind, I have to say 'The Flash' is about as much as I can enjoy one of these types of movies. This was a very fun ride I'm happy to admit.The movie is basically fan-service on overdrive. Anything a mega-fan has always wanted to see is likely going to show up at some stage in this movie. If that's your kind of thing then you are going to be in heaven.I found the pacing good. The movie is just short of 2 and a half hours but that time goes by pretty quickly. As usual in these types of superhero movies I found the final battle scene the weakest the film had to offer. It got messy and convoluted and it was really the one part of the movie where I lost interest.Of all the superhero movies I've seen this is probably the one least focused on the villain. He really does feel like an after-thought more than anything. The movie is far more about Barry Allen and his mission. Which makes it surprising to me just how much I enjoyed the film, because the one thing I do often get out of these films is enjoyment from the villain.I think people are going to have a good time with this one. It doesn't feel like the usual copy and paste template that the MCU has been throwing out for 15 years now and it is certainly a step up from everything non-Batman that DC has been doing recently. I really enjoyed this. 8/10.\",\n",

Not only is it much lighter in tone than most of the DC Extended Universe, but it's also wildly uneven, unsuccessfully trying to balance dramatic moments with constant attempts at lowbrow humor. The computer graphics are shockingly bad and are, at times, reminiscent of 2004's The Polar Express. There are some genuinely dramatic parts, when Ezra Miller isn't mugging for the camera, and I'd be lying if I said my childhood heart didn't surge with joy almost every time a Tim Burton's Batman reference was made, but The Flash was, for the most part, a disappointing fizzle.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'The Flash is a very stupid, very awkward, even occasionally unsettling film. It is also fascinating, mainly in terms of its production history and Warner Bros.\\'s unyielding devotion to completing it, even in the face of lead actor Ezra Miller\\'s expanding list of criminal offenses (recall that other DC projects have been scrapped for far less). Notably, a Flash picture has been in development since the Christopher Reeve days but the desperation to finally give this comic-book icon his own cinematic feature isn\\'t the whole story:This is supposed to be the great reset, where The Flash goes back in time and supposedly creates a new version of the DC Extended Universe where, I dunno, things are consistent, build patiently, and follow an actual plan. In a sense, DC needed this film and Flash\\'s reality-warping abilities. But what to do now that people think Miller is kind of a scumbag?Simple! Advertise it as a Batman story, revealing -- and emphasizing -- early on that we were really getting a crossover film; a DC equivalent to Spider-Man: No Way Home that unites several of our old \"favorites\", chief among them the Bruce Wayne of the Burtonverse. Yes, just like NWH brought back Maguire and Garfield for a final hurrah, Michael Keaton now reprises his version of the Caped Crusader one last (?) time. Between this and his barely-tacked-on-yet-heavily-marketed Vulture cameo in Morbius last year, I haven\\'t decided if Birdman (2014) has become funnier or more depressing.At least fanboys aren\\'t denying the Marvelism of the DCEU as they\\'ve done in the past. Instead, they seem painfully aware, starting up Twitter campaigns to fire James Gunn (the Marvel regular who, following a fairly successful attempt at winning over DCEU-skeptics with Peacemaker and The Suicide Squad, is set to \"lead\" whichever new DC-verse was created by this film), or sell the Snyderverse to Netflix, as per the hashtag #SellTheSnyderverseToNetflix, whatever they think that means. (At this point, I\\'m tempted to agree that Snyder\\'s version would have at least been more interesting than all this mess, had he gotten to see it through, but you\\'re kidding yourself if you think we\\'re going to see more of it than what The Snyder Cut teased any time soon, however much that \"restored epic\" might have contributed to DC\\'s seeming recovery circa 2021.)In the film, Barry Allen (Miller) uses his \"speed force\" abilities to do the verboten and go back through time to undo the death of his mother -- which his universe\\'s Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck), while knowing what he\\'s going through, advises against. In doing so, however, Barry predictably mucks up the timeline and winds up a very different reality, specifically a very different 2013. And so we don\\'t just get Keaton\\'s Bruce and an alternate Barry Allen (which, for what it\\'s worth, leads to some funny moments and some well-done doppelgänger effects), but also a version of the events in Man of Steel where the starfleet of General Zod (Michael Shannon) instead battles Supergirl (Sasha Calle), whose action figure is in stores now!So, no, we never actually return to the Burtonverse proper; instead, Barry\\'s voyage through time created an alternate timeline where Bruce Wayne was born earlier and looks like Keaton, a different Kryptonian than Kal-El was sent to Earth, the other heroes never came to be, and most importantly, Eric Stoltz evidently played Marty in Back to the Future. So by \"alternate timeline\", I mean that Barry\\'s journey to the past changed not just the timeline going forward, but the future and the past alike. (Bat-Keaton explains it to the two Barrys using bits of spaghetti at one point. Ha ha, tee hee.) Maybe I\\'m wrong. Maybe we are to understand that the timeline Barry creates is that of the Burton films, that this bumbling Bat-Keaton is somehow the one we all know, and that Pfeiffer\\'s Catwoman is still out there somewhere.We get a fair number of soulless, inconsequential, over-the-top action scenes -- some of which look like video games; others that look so shoddy and incomplete that they seem like experiments to test just how ugly this stuff can get before Twitter stans stop simping for it. They even placed the horizon at the dead center of the frame at several points during the battle with Zod, something clearly only Wes Anderson is allowed to do.In addition to the aforementioned cameos, there are a few I won\\'t reveal here, although I will tell you that digital reanimation of dead celebrities à la Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is involved, only it looks even worse now -- \"like Madame Tussaud\\'s wax figures laid over audio-animatronic puppets\", to quote Matt Zoller Seitz. These crossover moments typify fanservice key-jangling at its absolute worst; don\\'t expect the same thematic and narrative purpose as in Across the Spider-Verse, nor the same seamlessness. The pieces are just sort of shoved together, never mind the fact that Keaton\\'s Batsuit was clearly designed for darker, more atmospheric images (something that the now-canceled Batgirl film, also starring Keaton, seemed to get right) or that his Bat-wing absolutely could not go up against/outrun Kryptonian warships as seen in Snyder\\'s film.I\\'m going to paraphrase someone else\\'s hot take here: Remember when people complained about Ready Player One and how they didn\\'t invent any new pop culture for its futuristic setting, as if new things stopped being created around the 2010s and people kept obsessing over the same stuff forever? Given that, in the year of our lord 2023, Keaton is still/once again Batman and Ford is still/once again Indiana Jones, can you honestly blame Ready Player One for thinking that?Granted, I believe better times are ahead, even if the films we get out of Hollywood won\\'t strictly be original. When Quantumania loses out to Mario, the signs are clear. Theaters are back with a vengeance -- restriction-less and, in my hometown\\'s case, with better seating than ever -- and their stats speak plainly on the matter of MCU-style franchise films. Yes, we loved Guardians 3 (leave it to James Gunn to rescue every franchise under the sun) so it ain\\'t over till it\\'s over, but if you ask my opinion: Let the comic-book heroes rest, especially poor old Bat-Keaton and double-especially those who are actually dead IRL.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Finally, The Flash. After all the silenced controversy of its protagonist, one of the most promising films of the last stage of DC comes to light. The film was quite promising, and on balance... it falls short. Join me to find out why without stripping a single spoiler.Let's start from the essential: the script. The story is basic to be a contemporary superhero movie. It contains humor, which feels excessive in the middle of the film. It has a lot of action, from the very beginning of the footage, which is appreciated. But eventually we get to the topic of fashion. On a personal and subjective note, I'm already sick of the multiverse. At least be original and rename the concept! The next movie that dares to close down and make fun of this concept will have my wholehearted support. Anyway, this applies to using time travel of course, and showing a couple of rather impressive cameos.The direction is quite interesting. It has very daring use of angles and lenses that work very well with the story. The photography is effective and the edition is quite precise. The soundtrack is one of the great elements of the film that knows how to deal with nostalgia, but at times it feels too patchy. The acting is decent, as is the costume design.The controversial element of this film is undoubtedly the visual effects. Surely the effects are present in almost the whole movie and almost half of them are pretty bad. The human figure has no real references neither in movements nor in logical details. I have seen video games from outdated consoles with a better visuals than The Flash.Anyway. The Flash is a basic, action-packed movie that tries to be fun and emotional but fails too much in VFX, an element that its target audience is unforgiving in the year 2023.I end by saying that if Muschietti had come even a little closer to The Flashpoint Paradox, this movie would have been a masterpiece.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"So after being in development for years, multiple re-writes and director changes, the drama behind the film's star and with the current DC shakeup THE FLASH somehow still manages to be an okay comic-book film.You would think with all the change ups between the writers and the directors there would be some inconsistency within the film, but for the most part there wasn't. Now the hype train dubbed this as one of the greatest superhero/comic-book films ever made, and it really does not reach those heights, but it is a good entertaining film with some depth and layers.Putting aside all the Ezra Miller wrongdoings, they are very good in the film. Miller's performance in the theatrical cut of JUSTICE LEAGUE to me came off as a buffoon who made lame jokes about brunch. ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE however, that performance was more akin to what I wanted as a comic-book fan who's read Flash comics. Miller plays two versions of Barry, one older who shows more maturity and experience and one as a young teen, who is a more immature version of himself. There is a nice balance between both performances, but I will admit young Barry's antics and jokes kinda did get annoying after a while.Maribel Verdu's Nora Allen serves as Barry's motive to go back in time to save his mother. She has some good tender moments at the end when Barry does realize he needs to let her death play out. Ron Livingston replaces Billy Crudup and does a good job with the scenes he had.I've been on record saying Ben Affleck is my favorite Batman because I loved his brutality, his rage, and his merciless attitude. To me a Jim Lee drawing come to life. He's only in it in the beginning of the film where an incredibly fun action set piece takes place. If this is the last time I'll see him (which it probably will be) as the character then I'm happy I got to see him just once more.Michael Keaton definitely brought back the nostalgia. In his old age he hasn't lost a step and has a solid role within the film. Anything with him is basically fan-service on overdrive, especially the Elfman Batman score and his memorable lines from the 89 BATMAN film. Since it is the mutliverse keep an eye out for some cameos near the climax. Sasha Calle steps into the role of Supergirl and I didn't mind her presence or performance but she was just kinda there. She plays an important part, but it never marinated enough for it to feel any true weight, but to mainly be there to serve the action at the end. She does have a nice fight with Michael Shannon's Zod.Piggybacking off that, I really did like how director Andy Muschietti honored what came before with what Zack Snyder did. He didn't blatantly ignore it which I appreciated. So even if seeing Affleck, Shannon, and some other familiar Snyder-Verse cast members for just a quick bit, it was nice that there was an acknowledgment of what came before.Now the VFX are very questionable. I know Muschietti said that the VFX was meant to look weird on purpose and I get his reasoning behind it, but it just looked way too wonky. Distractingly wonky that it took me out of the film from time to time.As for the future of DC, that's all up in the air, it feels. Original set photos showed Supergirl and Keaton's Batman showing up at the end, but that has changed. Anything can happen now, and we'll see whether that's a good thing in time.To sum it up, THE FLASH is an overhyped film that just happens to be a good/entertaining spectacle with a narrative that isn't exactly new, but the nuances give it that extra flare that prevents it from being a total nostalgia bait/fan service.7/10.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'The Flash has finally arrived, a film I\\'ve been looking forward to since it came to fruition back in 2019 after many years in development of different directors/writers. Flashpoint would be the inspiration behind the film and that got me excited as I love the graphic novel, this isn\\'t a direct adaption, its inspired and has Barry Allen traveling back in time to save his mother as the plot point but after that, everything is different and honestly it works quite well in how you\\'ll be in for a ride that you\\'ll be unprepared for like The Flash in the film. Ezra Miller has been a topic of controversy for two years and I understand why someone would choose not to watch it for him but his performance is great in this and he\\'s better than ever as The Flash. Then came the marketing, making Michael Keaton the main Batman with him reappearing as his character from Tim Burton\\'s two Batman films, Sasha Calle as Supergirl and the first trailer brought back Michael Shannon as General Zod and Antje Traue as Faora-Ul which was the villains for \"Man of Steel\" which was the start of the DCEU, it feels fitting that they\\'re back for the ending (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will be the true conclusion). It also stars Ron Livingston, Maribel Verdú and Kiersey Clemons. With Ben Affleck along with other actors from the DCEU making cameos.Barry Allen uses his super speed to change the past, but his attempt to save his family creates a world without super heroes, forcing him to race for his life in order to save the future.The Flash is directed by Andy Muschietti from a screenplay by Christina Hodson, she wrote Birds of Prey prior to this so she has knowledge of the universe. Henry Braham served as a cinematographer for the film and shot The Suicide Squad prior to this aswell for the last two volumes of Guardians of the Galaxy. Benjamin Wallfisch did the musical score for the film and it\\'s a good soundtrack, music fitting each scene both light hearted and darker, also the more suspenseful scenes. I think it was nicely edited. Andy Muschietti\\'s direction was great, I really liked his vision for the project and how he wanted to make the project his own and fitting to the DCEU. I don\\'t have any criticism towards him, great visual storytelling and it felt like he gave great direction to the actors.The Flash met my expectations, it was a great superhero film which brought plenty of satisfying and joyful moments. I love the characters and DCEU, I think they did a good job at putting an ending to it. With the speed force and time traveling, we got the multiverse in film format (after seeing it in Arrowverse and Titans before), and I don\\'t want to spoil anything but you\\'ll surely find it worth sitting through. The Flash offers a lot of things to like, the visual effects could and should have been better though, the final battle sequence against General Zod deserved ten times better effects and a more detailed location. I also understand why Michael Shannon didn\\'t quite like it in this film just because of how one-dimensional Zod is and how there are almost no deep themes, I wouldn\\'t say there are no themes though as there\\'s one strong theme that\\'s executed perfectly on screen and in writing, the theme of loss. There was emotional depth in the film through the loss of Nora, Barry\\'s mother, it was executed perfectly and performed perfectly by Ezra Miller. The writing offered some great comedy, plenty of laughs from me and the others in the audience on the premiere, Ezra Miller had that comedic timing. Overall, I think the writing was great, much better than her work on Birds of Prey. The dialogue was great and so was the characterization. I really enjoyed the first and second act, they were golden. The third was fine but could have been better. The action sequences were great, all of them! Again, here the visual effects could have been better, but the action sequences were well thought out. It was also nice to see Michael Keaton back as Batman, he was great! I also liked Sasha Calle as Supergirl, good performance. This is a film I\\'ll rewatch, without a doubt. Great superhero film!',\n",

       "  'comment': \"SCORE: 8.4/10This was the ultimate DC fan movie. Watching this made me really sad to know that the DCEU is coming to close because it really did have a ton of potential. But, when Zach Snyder completely botches the introductions to the 2 most important characters, Superman and Batman, there is no surprise that they couldn't recover from that catastrophic mistake. Instead, I'm glad that they are going out with a bang. The Flash is one of the most ambitious films I've seen in a while. The story follows Flash as he travels back in time to save his mother, but by doing so gets a harsh lesson in the ways of the multiverse. Although it does share a lot of similarities to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, it still does add its own unique flavor instead of copying it verbatim.I've always really liked Flash as a character in the DCEU. Certainly not the Actor that plays him, but the character was always a highlight in a lot of other DCEU projects. The comedy was not as pendulum swinging between good and bad as something like Thor: Love and Thunder, but it did have its fair share of jokes that didn't land incredibly well. The rest of it was hilarious and I loved watching the two version of Barry interact with each other and show the duality of his personality. I found myself being able to connect emotionally with some of the scenes, but there was something inherently holding me back from connecting fully. I thought I would've been more emotional with the scenes between Barry and his mother, especially with the final scene where he has to say goodbye to her at the grocery store, but maybe the comedic nature of the film overshadows the biggest emotional moments of the movie. Well, at least for me.The trailers leading up to this project revealed way too much. I'm sure they felt the need to advertise with Michael Keaton's Batman in order to salvage the feeling people had towards the movie after Ezra Miller's criminal escapade, but it definitely takes away from the viewing experience of his character. With that said, the scenes he was in were fantastic and he adds a ton of value to the story. However, I feel like they did Supergirl's character an injustice. Her impact just wasn't felt as much as it should've. The fight scenes were cinematically beautiful and there is no denying the stunning audio and visuals DC has been known for. Also, the pop culture references were top tier.I saved the best for last. Anyone who watches this movie knows why I hold it in a higher regard than most of the comments I've made in this review so far. When dealing with a movie that involves the multiverse, you can imagine how it would open the opportunity for some pretty insane cameos and moments for longtime fans of DC. At this point, with any DC movie, it is a guarantee that you are going to get a Gal Gadot Wonder Woman cameo that lasts all of 2 minutes, which I am certainty not complaining about. The rest of the Justice League does get a lot of references during Barry's journey across the multiverse, but that initial interaction between Barry, Bruce, and Wonder Woman is hilarious and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. That damn Lasso of Truth. The rest of the big reveals come later on during the film's final act, where all of the universes begin to collide with one another. This was when peak excitement set in for what was to be revealed.As a casual fan of DC, meaning someone who hasn't read the comics and doesn't know every single minor character variation, one cameo particularly blew my socks off and had me smiling from ear to ear. That was Christopher Reeve's Superman. I like that they did have a little bit for each generation of DC fan, capping it off with the appearance of a Nicolas Cage's Superman. We weren't allowed to have our phones on during the sneak preview, so I had asked the guy sitting next to me about the significance of that character and if he had ever actually played Superman before, as I don't remember ever seeing him. He filled me in on the backstory behind everything and in that moment I had just felt the impact of what they did with this movie. It truly was the perfect movie for a DC fan.This last part needs its own section. The ONLY thing holding this back from being a 4.5 (9 on IMDB) instead of a 4 (8 on IMDB) is the absence of anything to do with Christian Bale's Batman. I don't know if that was a Christian Bale ego thing or something completely different, but there was a Christopher Nolan sized hole in this movie. I was fully expecting Barry to run into him in the ally during the post credit scene with Aquaman, but it ended up just being mid. I really got my hopes up when I saw a different Bruce Wayne step out of the car, only to find out it was George Clooney, which I thought was pretty funny. The last thing I will say about the film is that, just like some of the humor, a lot of the cameos and lines from the classic characters felt a bit forced and out of place for the sake of being a reference rather than an organic fit. Best DC movie since The Dark Knight? Absolutely not. Enjoyable film that I will be seeing for a second time? You bet!\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'What happened? What universe am in that this film is getting 8s 9s and 10s from audience members?The Flash is pure fan service for the sake of fan service, and it\\'s not even good fan service. All of it just serves as a distraction, and poor excuse for terrible writing, terrible storytelling, and atrocious pacing.When this movie starts, you better brace yourself because it doesn\\'t stop! Maybe this is intentional? Maybe it\\'s supposed to be fast and chaotic as to give audience members a feel for Barry\\'s life. But that can\\'t be because any sane person can see that is the poorest form of storytelling. This film jumps from scene to scene with no cohesive thought or balance. They took a collection of scenes and let a monkey edit everything together.The only time, the only time this movie actually stopped, and showed some sense was in its conclusion. Barry finally stopping and seeing the chaos and destruction he had caused in the multiverse, but because everything beforehand was set up so poorly that it just didn\\'t matter anymore. Then that ending just threw whatever good was in that sequence away in the dumpster.Now, NOT everything here is bad. The best this film has going for it are the performances. Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman was great. I was very happy to see him one last time as the caped crusader. Michael Keaton\\'s return was also great, though the explanation of why he was the way he was during his introduction was so weak. Ezra Miller (despite the trash human being, he may be) still does a great job as the Flash/Barry Allen. Michael Shannon\\'s return of General Zod while great was just why? He was absolutely inconsequential in this film. Literally, any villain could\\'ve been in Zod\\'s place. But I suppose it could be perceived that the real villain of this film was Barry himself, I guess. Lastly Sasha Calle, I enjoyed her immensely in her small role as Supergirl/Kara I don\\'t know if they have decided to have a Supergirl in the future of the DCEU, but I will be more than ok to see her reprise this role. Also, all the good moments this film had were in the trailers.There are other issues I have with this film, such as the CGI. While it wasn\\'t poor, I hated the style. It looked so fake and cartoony it just clashed with everything else in the film. During the opening sequence at the hospital the babies literally looked like dolls. It was hideous it bordered on uncanny valley levels of bad. My friend laughed at it continuously, and I\\'m pretty sure that sequence wasn\\'t meant to be funny, or at least if it was, I didn\\'t find it funny. Which will lead me into another issue, comedy. Nothing was funny here. All the jokes were so poor and ill placed. I couldn\\'t tell when the movie was serious or if it was supposed to be joking. The audience I was with barely laughed either.Then there\\'s the run time. I felt the entire 2 hours and 24 minutes, and for a movie that was so fast-paced, it was incredibly slow. In the middle of the movie, I looked at my phone to see only 1 hour passed. I couldn\\'t believe I had another hour and 20 minutes to go.Uh, what else... there\\'s a post credit-scene that\\'s used for comedic purposes but was unfunny and a waste of time to sit and wait for.Overall I can\\'t recommend watching this atrocious poor excuse of a DC film but if you like fan service for nothing more for the sake of well fan service and can turn your brain off to literally everything else then I\\'m sure you can have a good time.I don\\'t know how my fellow audience members felt about this movie but I\\'m almost 100% sure I heard one individual say \"this sucked\" as he walked out so maybe I\\'m not alone just in a vast minority.IMDb: 3/10\\nLetterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"When Justice League hit theatres in 2017, I'll admit that Ezra Miller's rendition of The Flash wasn't my favourite, but his version grew on me over the years. The DC films in the last ten years have been hit or miss though. You could never tell if a film was going to be good or not. Well, hearing everything that could happen in DC's latest release, The Flash, I had to see it for myself. I'm happy to report that after seeing it and sitting on my thoughts for a couple of days, I can confidently say that this is one of DC's better films in the last 5-10 years and the emotional core packs a great punch.Having lost his mom in the past, Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) decides to use his super speed to run back in time to prevent her death and prevent his father from being wrongfully accused of her murder. In doing so, he ends up in another reality where he meets another version of himself, another version of Batman, and another version of an alien from Krypton. Also returning is the villain Zod, from the film Man of Steel. This was a fun ride to take and the action is great, but the storyline involving his mom is what worked the most for me and brought me to tears by the end. If for nothing else, the writers cared very much about the mother-son relationship.Everyone seems to be talking about how awful the CGI is as well, but I personally found certain sequences were meant to feel like an animation instead of looking realistic. Maybe that's just me, but I was able to forgive most of the effects because I felt that way. Still, I do agree some more polishing may have been needed. Still, the CGI did not take me out of the movie as some critics have been stating. In fact, without giving anything away, certain elements needed CGI that could only be done so well in the first place, so I gave them a bit of a pass. The furthest thing to think about when talking about this film is the visual effects though, so let's move on.I must say, yes it was cool to see Michael Keaton with the cape and cowl once again, but with all the cameos sprinkled throughout this film, I am starting to think I'll miss this world a bit as they get moving in another direction with DC. Although funny, this film felt most like Man of Steel in terms of care and effort being put into the story and tone. This film set out to be an emotional story before being a fan service fest, which I appreciated. All the cameos throughout the film just felt like the icing on the cake.The Flash is a film that I pretty much had no expectations for so I am surprised how much I enjoyed it. Ezra Miller carries this film with a very solid performance, Andy Muschietti delivered as director, and Christina Hodson and Joby Harold truly wrote a compelling story arc for Barry Allen. Does the film get a little much by the end and overstay its welcome in terms of bombastic visuals? Maybe, but if I'm going to nitpick that, then I have a lot of things to nitpick as well, but none of them really bothered me. I was here for a good time and I got a little more than just that, which put a big old smile on my face. If you're thinking you're interested at all based on what you've seen so far, I think you'll like this one. I recommend it.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"The Flash is a junk food movie, but sometimes junk food hits the spot. I think in this case, it kind of did, and I had fun. There are problems here for sure, and maybe it'll all fall apart in my mind the more I think about it. But I had a pretty good time with this, and while it might not have been as filling or satisfying as a proper piece of cínèmá, I feel like as far as unapologetic crowd-pleasers go, this is one of the better ones.It has fun with a time travel plot, and also dives right into all that multiverse stuff that's all the rage at this point. We may be at a breaking point soon with movies that spiral off into different universes/timelines, in the process bringing back actors to roles they haven't occupied for years or even decades, but I know I still get some enjoyment out of this kind of thing. In a couple of years, who knows - there's a good chance fatigue will set in around this latest trend, but unlike a lot of cinematic trends/sub-genres, this one has at least inspired universally loved movies and even Oscar winners (like Into the Spider-Verse and of course Everything Everywhere All At Once).The Flash is a movie that's desperate for you to like it, and I can see that turning some people off. But others are probably going to like it a lot, and I imagine it'll do well at the box office. As for the future of DC, that's all up in the air, it feels. Anything can happen now, and we'll see whether that's a good thing in time. I'm also interested to see how fans of previous DC movies react to this, given how divided the fanbase is (and how fractured all the different DC universes are, what with the extra worlds of Robert Pattinson's Batman and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker).But The Flash? It's fun. It's entertaining. It panders sometimes. It looks a bit like a video game at points (also plays out like one at times). Its humour generally lands, but not always. I'll probably never watch it again, but I had a good time watching it just this once.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Much better than I thought and reviews led me to believe. Superwoman really worked for me. Michael Keaton was good. Ezra Miller wasn't hyper annoying. I could've done without the updated flash effects and the suit but not too bad. It's funny, fairly interesting and the plot isn't super convoluted or especially ridiculous (for a superhero movie).Saw reviews complaining about inconsistent CGI quality. For most of the movie I couldn't figure out why; clearly an artistic choice. But then Chris Reeve pops up and yeah, that was pretty bad. I think it's the result of applying the stylistic effects they'd been using on the still-alive actors to an already not awesome deepfake but whatever the reason it was jarring and not necessary. There were a lot of nods and Easter eggs they would've been fine skipping.So not perfect but nothing ruined it for me. Batman in the beginning really didn't sound like Affleck to me. They gave their Batman a healthy dose of Christopher Nolan Batman that I could've done without (what possible reason is there for having vents on your breastplate. Do his pectorals generate too much wind resistance when he flexes?)Anyway worth seeing. Stands up well with the other DC movies, such as they are. I really don't see what the problem is if you liked all they other stuff. This is easily better than Aquaman and Justice League and Snyder-bloat Justice League. Yeah Ezra Miller is going through an annoying as all hell/total trainwreck phase lately. But hey, who hasn't sorta kidnapped an Indian and hoarded guns and acted like a total b!#h@$$ after they got arrested for something stupid and avoidable.. yet again, then whined about it/their/thouest pronouns to someone that made the mistake of addressing them with respect? That old chestnut. Just a steaming hot mess of human being but considering all that he's gotta be pretty talented since I was still able to enjoy his character in the movie.I wouldn't be expecting a sequel though. Oh yeah, Michael Shannon was predictably good also, though not utilized all that much.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'This is the definition of a mixed bag film. Firstly ever since this was announced this has been my most eager film to see in many decades. I loved Michael Keaton as Batman and I loved the prospect he was coming back. In the end I am giving it a 5, for one main reason; Ezra Miller.\\'They\\' cannot act. \\'They\\' have no charisma and is simply annoying. The first 20mins of the film I was wincing and grimacing in my seat hating it just hoping for Michael Keaton to arrive.Now what made matters so much worse was Ezra Miller goes back in time and meets his teenage self, who is somehow infinitively more annoying. Quite literally think of Jar Jar Binks and you have the sort of level this was played as. This Jar Jar Binks is in the whole movie. Now to add matters worse was knowing the real life criminality by Ezra Miller and all he has been involved in. It honestly made me feel like I was watching a Mindhunter episode seeing him. It was not appealing. The film should have been reshot with someone else playing the Flash. It wasn\\'t like \\'\\'they\\' is a good actor.An hour in I honestly almost got up and left the cinema. Then Michael Keaton arrived and at first I thought, Warmers have blown it. This is not going to live up to my memory in anyway. However soon that was changed and Michael stole the film completely.What I will also say, on introduction to Supergirl. I was groaning at that too, as she was first seen as a tiny, skin and bones mess. I was thinking to myself, this is supposed to be Supergirl. Why do Warner\\'s cast people like this to play Superhero\\'s. However I need to apologise immensely for thinking that, because as soon as she put on the suit, her body language, charisma and demeanour changed and I was thinking \"wow she is actually a very good Supergirl\". This is what happens when someone can actually act. They can give people that shock of what they project.In the end I have serious mixed feelings - I loved, immensely, Michael Keaton and I loved Supergirl. But I hated the Flash. Now when the entire film is called the Flash I am stuck. Hence I am giving this a 5. It should have been called Supergirl though and just had Batman and Supergirl in it. If the film had of been Supergirl with Batman helping her I would have given this an 8.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'I am not exaggerating when I say this is one of the best DC movies so far. It perfectly adapts the source material to the current characters of the Snyderverse and bridges the gap between the old and the new DC universe that began with a more colorful and characteer-driven Aquaman and Wonder Woman movies (in spite of the flaws these may have).The screenplay in this movie, that is the story and character arcs, is absolutely gold. It is witty, funny and splendidly well-rounded. All the jokes land perfectly and it is all thanks to the great performance of Ezra Miller, which would be more acclaimed if it weren\\'t for the bad reputation that preceeds him.And perhaps a bit surprisingly, every other character introduced and \"returning\" do a fantastic performance, elevated by their characterization. Audiences should be really satisfied with the directions they took every main character in this film.I don\\'t want to get into spoilers so I will just mention that the costume and set design is incredibly imaginative. The story is inspired by a famous Flash comicbook but it is modified enough to be more relevant to the current iteration of the Flash while maintaining the core messages and themes. And in some aspects, actually improve the story itself. All amounting to a climax where the emotional payoff is earned.It is obvious the care and effort that was put into this movie in almost all aspects except one. One that seems to be the weaker link in all DC movies: the subpar CGI. I don\\'t doubt the talents of the CGI artists at Warner Bros, but there\\'s something happening behind close doors. Either time constraints (which seems unlikely given DC doesn\\'t pump out as much content as Marvel), lack of workforce or simply budget constraints? (again, highly unlikely given the budgets these movies have). It\\'s unfortunate because it is subpar enough to break the illusion (is very noticeable when you see shots of Flash\\'s costume switching from CGI to physical costume on a close-up). But is imaginative enough to be overlooked.And again, the heavy lifting is done by the story and characterisation, which is stellar. Add there the performances and visually stunning action set pieces and you have great entertainment. The relationships between the characters is well defined and come full circle in the end, I applaud the use of every character and their comic book iteration and I thank the good and restraint use of the easter eggs and references which the nature and trailer of this movie clearly disclosed there would be (so that wasn\\'t really a spoiler)All in all, this is a great direction to take DC on and in some ways, this movie feels kind of James Gunn-y: the characters are compelling, some wacky and hilarious, others more subdued but also witty; the relantionships between them are earned and emotionally satisfying and the story is character driven; and things like the editing and music-heavy montage scenes (not saying they are uniquely Gunn, but they reminisce of GUnn). And most importantly: the movie has something compelling to say. Which may sound obvious, but a lot of superhero movies lately have lost track of it. Surely they are visually stunning and action driven, but we can\\'t forget the characters and their flaws and strengths, and exploring both is always a great idea! So more, please, more of this quality of DC.',\n",

Warner hoping that everyone in the theater is pointing at the screen going,\"hey that\\'s that guy who was in that other film who played the other guy...\" Over and over and over again. And maybe just maybe one of the ones they tossed up there was a favorite of the viewer in the theater. That way they might forget that Ezra Miller broke a bunch of laws and Warner seriously thought no one would care.As far as the Flash storyline, all Flash fans know the Flashpoint storyline. It\\'s as retold as the Batman \"creation\" story. Flash uses the speed force to travel through time to change things so that his mom no longer dies, and so his dad never has to go to prison for the murder of his mom. He believes that the minor change he chooses to make to get this to occur won\\'t be more than that\"butterfly effect\" and everything will be fine. But before he ever tries this, he has discussed it repeatedly with Bruce Wayne. Asking him how he would feel if he could save his parents. Bruce says everything is meant to happen, even bad things. To not mess with time.But Barry never listens.I have to say getting to experience\"my Batman\" in Michael Keaton once again was a punch of nostalgia. He kicked butt playing the roll, even as an older guy, as if it had only been a few years. The Supergirl storyline was meh. Same with Zod. Watching Ezra talking to himself most of the film was annoying. It was like nails on a chalkboard.For the love of all that\\'s holy Grant Gustin...please take the reign.',\n",

But the script and execution seemed a bit, dare I say it rushed.If I were to wax lyrical, which I will, might I say that there's one key lesson to be learned from the theme of this movie that perhaps wasn't followed by its makers?It's no spoiler to note that the idea of going back in time to adjust the past and thereby repair the present is a sweet temptation. But when we remove that limitation of linear time, binding us to our past mistakes, trouble seems to stem out in all directions. OK, so my analogy is that by relying heavily on CGI to theoretically create anything that one's imagination can conceive, the temptation is to consciously turn everything up to 10 (or 11 if you're in Spinal Tap) and conjure up endlessly amazing experiences. But we're linear beings, for the most part. We need common reference points to know where and who we are. Otherwise, we go off the rails.That's what I felt was absent from the The Flash movie. Too much of what could be but not enough of what is. We're left disoriented and, ultimately, a bit disengaged.If I were to go back in time and change something I would have spent more time focusing on the drama of having two Barrys in existence - excellent FX work and acting here. But that'd mean less time for Batman (good stuff) ... and Supergirl (more good acting) and less of the smaller character parts (funny performances, all). OK. Let me readjust.

I was surprised by the tone, it is much less darker than the other DCEU movies and is tonally similar to Wonder Woman 1984.The opening scene for me rang alarm bells.. the CGI is absolutely laughable with utterly ridiculous scenes bordering of complete silliness. Superman 3 comes to mind. It literally features the worst CGI I have seen in a long time, it felt like I was watching an animated cartoon.The tone then shifts to darker territory briefly when the plot moves along, before suddenly jolting you back to the lighter silliness.Ezra Miller does an ok job in the titular role. He seems to be having fun with the character as does Michael Keaton, who steals the scenes when he finally appears on screen.There are many clever cameos throughout, however brief some may be and it feels like a nice homage to the DC movies of yesteryear.Overall, yeah the CGI was terrible and it tries hard and fails to deliver what Spiderman NWH did much better, but it's a fun ride nevertheless and I did enjoy it.\",\n",

If The Flash can go back in time to save his mom from being killed by a mysterious killer, wouldn't he want to find out who the killer was and capture them? Instead, he just wants to swap out a can of tomato soup so her father would never leave home and she would be alone. Whatever. I'd want to know who the real killer was and capture them and a superhero would too.Suddenly, there are two Barry Allen's and most of the film is cringe annoying dialogue between the two of them that mostly isn't funny.Thankfully, the film picks up when they have to stop General Zod from the Man of Steel, and to do that they have go find more superheroes and the only who who exists in this new reality is Michael Keaton's Batman. And...it's awesome to see Keaton back as Batman.Instead of having two dumb heroes, the film now has at least one hero who uses their intelligence, strength, deduction, and stealth to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Truly a cool thing to see, and easily the highlight of the film and if this is what it took to get Keaton back...at least someone got the job done.Supergirl also shows up and it's actually pretty cool to see two Flashes, Supergirl, and Keaton Batman team up to battle Zod.The final act of The Flash is ambitious and there is enough cool attempts to do something unique that it's hard to dock the film entirely. The real problem with The Flash is The Flash himself, and the writing. This isn't a well written film it has tons of bizarre logic and potholes and stupid unlikable characters...but somehow it all sort of makes something that passed the time and - if for just a moment - made me smile.But, they should have just made a third Keaton Batman movie.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"It's a fitting end to the DCEU, in the sense that it's an absolute mess (like most of the DCEU)! The script is just hands-down bad, and the only really redeeming qualities are Michael Keaton's Batman and Sasha Calle's Supergirl (both in terms of the performances, and the way the characters were written)Its got some pretty cool scenes, and there were some times that I got genuine chills, but it is lightyears from being a good movie. Like, when the use of the legendary theme from the 1989 Batman film was one of the best parts of it... That's not exactly greatI didn't even go in with high expectations, either. I was expecting something just alright (maybe like a 5/10), and the fact that it didn't even meet those relatively low expectations is just shockingHonestly, I just don't want to waste more time talking about it. I would say the only reasons to watch it would be Batman, Supergirl and just because it's the end of the DCEU. Other than that, it's not worth the time or money.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"So here it is, the end to the high concept, but ultimately failed DCEU cinematic universe, resetting the timeline for a new cinematic universe, which will undoubtedly be much worse.The Flash starts horribly. We get a random and very silly opening action scene with Ben Afflecks Batman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman appearing for one final phoned in appearance and a lot of extremely bad CGI hijinks. Admittedly, I did chuckle at the baby in the microwave, but the tone is just all over the place.Once Flash moves back in time and meets his younger self, the film goes completely off the rails, with the younger Flash being unbearably annoying. While there is a purpose and a character arc to this, it still grates ones nerves. Ezra Miller overactings, trying his best to do the wide eyed clumsy-fasttalking-annoyingly-likeable thing that Tom Holland does. In some scenes he succeeds, in others he misses the beat. However, he does show some range, with the older Flash generally being a pretty good audience avatar and the one voice of reason.The film miraculously gets back on track once Keaton's Batman shows up. He steals the show in his scenes, but the inclusion of Danny Elfman's musical themes doesn't fit the mood of the film at all and just serves as a reminder of what a beautiful gothic opera the 1989 original was, whereas the Flash is a tonal mess from start to finish.As if the two styles of score weren't bad enough, they place some rock / pop song over a major action scene in a cheap attempt to imitate James Gunn's overuse of pop music in Guardians of the Galaxy.The story of the Flash actually turns pretty good as it moves towards the finale. The character arcs are brilliant, the teambuilding with Supergirl is good, and in her brief screentime she is excellent.During the finale, there are moments of real tragedy, and especially when Barry meets his mother again, the film is legitimately moving and quite sad. If it had taken itself more seriously, this would have been an incredibly powerful finale.One more note on Michael Keaton:\\nSeeing his performance made me realize what a damn tragedy it was that Warner messed up the Batman IP this badly over the years. We could have had decades of Keaton as Batman, taking on a rogue gallery of interesting villains in Burton's wonderful gothic nightmare city. While Nolan's Dark Knight films were fantastic, Keaton just embodied Batman like no one else.Instead, they wasted time and money on the awful Schumacher films with Kilmer and Clooney (who's cameo here is actually fun), Snyder's failed take on Batman and the watchable but sterile and unnecessary recent series with Robert Pattinson. Warner were sitting on pure cinematic, iconographic gold and didn't realize it.The Flash flopped horribly at the box office. Was it deserved? Yes and no. The film is a tonal mess graverobbing past DC movies while unceremoniously killing off Zack Snyder's high concept cinematic universe. On the other hand, it has a good plot, strong performances and is still leagues above any of the junk Marvel belches out every few months.What does the future hold now? As the superhero genre goes the way of the Western (meaning it's dead in the water), DC will reboot and give us misanthropic garbage from James Gunn, which will undoubtedly be far worse than the past DC films, as it undermines every remotely emotional moment with a joke, be filled with popsongs, random family guy style humor, and probably fail within 5 years. Good job Warner.After the Flash bombed so badly, and with superhero movies on the way out, I doubt DC will ever get back on its feet in the near term. Batman will still be a success if they don't ruin the brand.Who knows, maybe they could do one more Keaton / Burton Batman or bring Nolan and Bale back. Anything other than Batman, and they will lose a lot of money.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'While this movie is entertaining it doesn\\'t introduce any new ideas. It basically rides the trend of every superhero movie that has come out in the past year. They all have a story that deals with time and multiple timelines. This movie unfortunately was released after \"Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse\" and it basically does a lot of what that film did but it did not do it better.There are many scenes where the faces of the characters (mostly the flash) are obviously CGI. There are also scenes where The Flash stops time and it just looks very animated. Namely the scene that involves multiple babies. This didn\\'t take away from my experience but it was noticeable on numerous occasions. There was also a Spanish song used during an emotional scene that didn\\'t fit. It was very random and confusing.Ezra Miller was enjoyable playing different versions of himself and showing his range as actor. He delivered some serious emotional moments as well as some silly comedic moments.Sasha Calle as supergirl felt like a weak attempt at including \"Superman\" into the story and this film would have worked better without it. I didn\\'t hate her character, she was just okay.General Zod was another character that didn\\'t work in this film. I understand why he was included and how he was used to tie together this multiverse idea but he wasn\\'t exciting.The character I had the most fun watching on screen was Batman. Every version of him was just amazing and exciting to see. Every scene that involved Batman felt crisp and well done while The Flash had many clunky scenes. On a side note, Michael Keaton\\'s involvement in this film should have been kept a secret. The trailers continue to show too much ruining movie experiences.There were some cool cameos in this film but as I stated before it has been done before. I expected more from this film considering the amount of times it was delayed. There were some cool scenes and action sequences but this movie needed a better story. The characters just weren\\'t strong enough for the audience to care about them. Sometimes less is more but sometimes a character has such a small role that it\\'s much better not to include them (Iris West).In the end I just felt like I\\'ve seen this movie already with different characters. I still look forward to the next film I just hope it goes in a different direction and leaves the timelines alone.',\n",

As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I\\'m glad that I did. Here is my review written as a prententious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig\\'s latest directorial venture, \"Barbie,\" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unraveling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig\\'s live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie\\'s role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I\\'m giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Barbie Movie ReviewWritten by Gerwig and her partner, Noah Baumbach, the movie introduces Barbie on yet another perfect day in Barbie Land, in which dolls played by humans exist in what resembles a toyland gated community. There, framed by a painted mountain range, Barbie and a diverse group of other Barbies rule, living in homes with few exterior walls. With their flat roofs, clean lines and pink décor - a spherical TV, tulip table and chairs - the overarching look evokes the era when Barbie first hit the market. It\\'s an aesthetic that could be called bubble-gum mid century modern.This is a movie that acknowledges Barbie\\'s unrealistic physical proportions-and the kinds of very real body issues they can cause in young girls-while also celebrating her role as a feminist icon.As the film\\'s star, Margot Robbie finds just the right balance between satire and sincerity. She\\'s the perfect casting choice; it\\'s impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. The blonde-haired, blue-eyed stunner completely looks the part, of course, but she also radiates the kind of unflagging, exaggerated optimism required for this heightened, candy-coated world. Her performance is a joy to behold.And then there\\'s Ken. Ryan Gosling is a consistent scene-stealer as he revels in Ken\\'s himbo frailty. He goes from Barbie\\'s needy beau to a swaggering, macho doofus as he throws himself headlong into how he thinks a real man should behave. Gosling sells his square-jawed character\\'s earnestness and gets to tap into his \"All New Mickey Mouse Club\" musical theater roots simultaneously. He\\'s a total hoot.Barbie can be hysterically funny, with giant laugh-out-loud moments generously scattered throughout. They come from the insularity of an idyllic, pink-hued realm and the physical comedy of fish-out-of-water moments and choice pop culture references as the outside world increasingly encroaches. But because the marketing campaign has been so clever and so ubiquitous, you may discover that you\\'ve already seen a fair amount of the movie\\'s inspired moments, such as the \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" homage and Ken\\'s self-pitying \\'80s power ballad.This movie is perhaps a giant two-hour commercial for a product, although no more so than The Lego Movie, yet Barbie doesn\\'t go for the comedy jugular anywhere near as gleefully as that. It\\'s entertaining and amiable, but with a softcore pulling of punches: slightly ionized, celebratory nostalgia for a toy that still exists right now. Still, if such a crowd-pleasing extravaganza can also offer some fodder for thoughtful conversations afterward, it\\'s accomplished several goals simultaneously.',\n",

Personally that's what I liked the most, how the fantasy and the reality interact. The actors were amazing too, and not only the main characters.Some other human characters were underdeveloped compared to Barbie and Ken, but that was expected.As a man I recon that this is a movie that speaks to women, but also to men sensible to women struggles.

I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.\",\n",

Barbie is at its best when it\\'s extremely self aware and knows exactly what it\\'s doing and how it\\'s doing it, but then halfway in, it feels like the movie gets a little too carried away and takes itself too seriously, loosing its humor somewhere down the line and leaving us experiencing moments are painful to sit through (like yea, please preach for the millionth time how everything is the patriarchy and how women have it the worst in society and how victimized they are).Barbie is without a doubt as vibrant as it is energetic, but you get the feeling that despite its best moments, it\\'s a movie waiting to be forgotten... the fault of it lying entirely on the direction in which the movie\\'s second half went.

At least 85% of the movie was pure hype, creating high expectations that were ultimately let down.The film seemed primarily aimed at a teenage audience, with its trendy aesthetics and themes, but it struggled to find its identity. It swung between childish and adultish elements, making it challenging to categorize and leaving viewers like me feeling a bit perplexed about its target demographic.In the first two-thirds of the movie, I managed to find a few moments to laugh, but my interest began to wane as it entered the final third. The lack of a compelling plot and engaging storytelling made it a tedious watch, and I found myself almost falling asleep in the cinema.One of the major letdowns was the extensive marketing that overshadowed the entire experience. What made the movie even more uncomfortable for me was the audience's overwhelming obsession with everything pink. Nearly 90% of the cinema-goers were dressed in various shades of pink, and it felt like an extravagant posing session rather than an immersive movie experience. It did not help that movie itself was pretty average - it heavily depends on references and superficial jokes, which can be amusing on occasion. However, after being exposed to nearly two hours of such content, I was completely brain damaged .I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a Barbie movie, but this certainly wasn't it. It fell into the same pit as some of Disney's live-action adaptations that fail to capture the essence of the original material.Despite having a few moments of laughter and initial intrigue, I wouldn't rate it more than 4 out of 10. If you're looking for a meaningful cinematic experience, this film might not be the best choice.\",\n",

With enough self-awerness, humour and silly moments this was everything I hoped for. The budget was also insane, I can't wait to rewatch this so I can look at all the details again. The way Barbie moves, walks, drinks, acts?? Perfection.Also surprisingly emotional, I didn't expect to cry during a movie about a doll. But well wel well, it happened.Anyway, it deserves all the hype. Margot Robbie IS Barbie, there is nobody who could've done the role justice like her.And Ryan? Well, he's just Ken.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'SCORE: 7.8/10Letterboxd continues to be goated. The pink heart is a nice touch. Maybe my expectations were a bit too high, but could you blame me? The marketing for this movie was undoubtedly some of the best that has ever been done. The film wasn\\'t bad by any stretch of the imagination, but there definitely was a feeling of being underwhelmed, which has to do with a lot of things. First, because the marketing was so amazing, it felt like I had seen 75% of the movie already before stepping foot in the theater. The story is good, but I think it really struggled with straddling the line between being a social commentary and being goofy and funny. It did a decent job of both, but each side hindered the ability for the other to have maximum impact. Because of that, it led to a lot of parts feeling forced, almost in an attempt to balance out the levels at very inopportune times. The timing was slightly off and created a couple awkward stretches where you were waiting for something to be funny, but it ended up being serious for a bit too long.With all that said, I still have a fun time with the premiere, and I\\'m not going to let knowing of all the good parts take away from how good they actually were. The songs were catchy, the vibes were superb, and the cast was amazing. Michael Cera as Allan and his involvement in the story was definitely a nice surprise. However, to no surprise, the stars of the show, me and Margot Robbie...I mean Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie killed it as Ken and Barbie. As a man, I thought the jabs at men were hilarious and warranted. The best type of comedy is relatable comedy, and I think they did a good job with it. The references to other movies were also cool, especially their dig at Zack Snyder\\'s Justice League. The Film Bros are going to HATE this movie. The set pieces for this film were very impressive, and Greta Gerwig seems like an amazing human being.My criticisms of this movie are not to be taken as me being disappointed or even that I didn\\'t like parts of it. I think I just saw the potential this movie had and it flashed it to us occasionally, but ultimately fell short. I am happy to be living in a time where Barbenheimer is happening and we can celebrate cinema together, but I have a feeling that Oppenheimer is going to blow this thing out of the water, no pun intended. If you look at my Perfect Score Ranking, you will see that I am not shy to express my more \"feminine\" side and appreciate movies that maybe most men wouldn\\'t. I was really expecting for this film to be a huge hit for me, but it ended up just being good. Which is okay! I definitely still recommend for people to see it, and I will be jamming to the songs of the soundtrack in my car. Well done Greta and team!',\n",

The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..\",\n",

But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'My Review - Barbie\\nIn Cinemas now\\nMy Rating 6.5/10I\\'ve been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because I\\'m a great fan of Margo Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig\\'s work.I held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and I\\'d love it or a huge disappointment and I\\'d loathe it in other words no in between for me.How ever that\\'s not the case I didn\\'t love it and I didn\\'t loathe it I have to accept that I\\njust didn\\'t get it ?Perhaps it\\'s because that I\\'m a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted .Barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they won\\'t see Barbie.The audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that I didn\\'t and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusion.No spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be. Barbie and Ken leave the other Barbies and Ken\\'s behind in Barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical Barbie played to perfection by Margo Robbie . Barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimism.Ken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by Ryan Gosling joins Barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at Venice Beach California complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of Barbie land are reversed in the real world . The question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live in?Pink cloud sunny Barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of Corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and die?Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the film.Barbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while I hope it\\'s popular for the creators of the movie I\\'m left puzzled at what audience it\\'s aimed at ?The male population that Greta Gerwig cleverly parodies through Ken and his Ken buddies certainly wouldn\\'t see her movie and I think the Disney generation of under 15 would be bored .I did enjoy the technical aspects of Barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbuster.I also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like Stanley Kubric\\'s 2001 A Space Odysee , Saturday Night Fever, and of course The Wizard of Oz .It\\'s one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of Warner Bros then in 2019 they finally announced Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the lead actor-director duo for this film.Director Greta Gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with Noah Baumbach basing their story on the famous Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel . It is the first live action Barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success .Mattel, the toy company that created Barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in Greta Gerwig\\'s clever perhaps to clever script.Mattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the old-school charm of the Barbie world intact and I suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous Barbie dolls get a mention in this film.Noah Baumbach is Executive Producer as well as his partner Greta Gerwig and Margo Robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of $145 million US$.Margo Robbie has been quoted as saying \"that the film\\'s aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences \"the thing you didn\\'t know you wanted.I\\'m not so sure about that statement as Barbie didn\\'t reach my expectations and I felt the thing I didn\\'t know I wanted wasn\\'t what I wanted at all.Top marks to Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that Greta Gerwig named \"Techni-Barbie,\" after the Technicolor format. Also top marks to two time Academy Award Winner designer Jacqueline Durran. It\\'s a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie,',\n",

This movie confirmed that Greta Gerwig is the most overrated director in Hollywood. Her direction of this movie was supposed to give it legitimacy but in reality it turned a simple fun concept into something overburdened by self righteous ideology. Critics love her because they have to but this is her third major project that was good but not great.On to Barbie.Is it a social commentary? Sometimes. Is it a comedy? Sometimes. Is it narrow misandry disguised as feminist manifesto? Sometimes. Is it a movie engineered by a literal toy company in attempt to keep their product relevant? Yes, entirely.There's only so much you can elevate a corporate owned propaganda piece. Even more depressing is this is aimed squarely at tween-age girls, who will inevitably carry it to massive box office success despite the problematic messaging and self defeating view of gender norms.Anyone whispering the words Oscar consideration should have their head examined.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"I appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's first two films. I knew absolutely nothing about Barbie except that it was a doll. The trailers didn't impress me. I slept less than an hour last night. I watched the movie alone surrounded by teenagers who cheered when the WB logo appeared in pink.The conditions were set for this to go wrong, but Gerwig's vision for Barbie won me over. The film starts in the perfect, goofy, and funny Barbie Land, but it doesn't take long to move to the real world. Curiously, while most of the action in the real world works well, it's also where I felt some issues, mainly with the Mattel executives' characters. Let's say it was the only time I felt that the silliness of the film (and it's indeed very silly) went too far. The third act wraps everything up perfectly, with some fantastic speeches and a strong conclusion. Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie, but there's a big surprise in America Ferrera, and Ryan Gosling steals all the attention whenever he's on screen. All the supporting cast is hilarious.Younger audiences will love the colours, the incredible production design, and the light tone. However, this is a very adult film in the themes it addresses, managing to be highly relevant without ever ceasing to entertain. The feminist traits are well-defined, and it's an homage to women, but not only that. It's primarily about self-discovery, finding our own path, and being true to ourselves.\",\n",

The constructed reality is as complex as if Morpheus from \"the Matrix\" offered you the third pill which conjoins two worlds. Deserves the hypeI hope I don\\'t dive super deep here, if I say that the beginning reminds me of Wlater Benjamin\\'s \"Berlin Childhood\". Playing with toys knows to be joyful and lucid, but really reats some new and confusing \"realty\". To add up, this movie seems to be much more philosophical than \"The Matrix\", I would say. That dimension opens up right afterer \"blue pill vs red pill\" reference was made, because here we hd those two realities colide, \"imagenary\" and \"real*, creating the conjoined \"third realm\" where we see how both realites influence and shape each other. As Slavoj Zizek once pointed out: \"we need a third pill\", so here it is.At that point in the movie, story takes a new turn bringing into the focus some familiar social & existential struggles of modern times, providing us with its own critique of it. And it llooks like they had great success doing it. Seemingly effortlessly, they manged to bring out some greater point, keeping the great dynamics, adding the great amount of comedy to it. That was actually so impressive.Here ill pull the breaks, I would rather not to try to explain the movie or interprete it, .. Just wanna to say in the end that I strongly rrecommend it for watching. It\\'s fun, profound, its reveling and bringing out so many different layers talking about the social/existential dilemas and actually you can learn much from watching it.

The landscape does not look right, some weapon effects look lousy, yet it is somewhat of a gun-gear-show. Which is cool, they did that a lot in the 80s and people now consider those flicks to be cult. The soundtrack is really nice and fitting. The girl being saved sometimes talks and looks like the Alia character from Lynch´s Dune movie. Maybe that is related to shock story-wise, ok I get it.

       "  'comment': 'Some poor production decisions and pacing made what could have been a really good movie drag down to a disappointing level. The third in a line of Afghan rescue films this one has a simpler and better story than the convoluted Kandahar, with a much smaller budget but does not compare to the superior Guy Richie\\'s The Covenant.To start with the movie drags for no reason what so ever and is at least 30 minutes too long. The slow pacing was set in the very first scene with drawn out drone cinematography shots and prolonged, unnecessary radio discussions. I suspect the director wanted to try and give the movie a dramatic mood but instead just made it seem like they were waiting around half the time and not really in a rush to escape from the enemy. So you don\\'t get any build up or sense of urgency. Films like this need a quick pace that accelerates to the finale. This movie would start to get some momentum and then they would drag out the literally repetitive fire fights to a point where they made little sense.The interactions between the lead and the five year old girl were excellent but you never felt they were escaping from the enemy and instead on some stroll through the woods. The lead did not even pick her up to carry her until half way through the movie which makes it unbelievable that the enemy did not catch up to them before this while walking at the speed of a five year old.The military aspect of the film was better than I expected in a few parts and completely laughable in others. 1. The lead is not going to survive a 50 foot fall out of a helicopter without broken bones. 2. For a Special Forces Operator he was wasting a ton of ammunition for no reason and taking a lot of shots at rocks. 3. He appeared to constantly be doing weapon malfunction drills though I believe they were trying to show that he was clearing a jam. I am sure this was intended to make it seem more \"realistic\" but properly maintained HK416s or custom Noveske AR-15 platforms are highly unlikely to have all these failures. 4. He loaded magazines and racked the charging handle instead of more quickly using the bolt release. 5. He always seemed to have the same amount of magazines on him no matter how many rounds he shot. I do not understand why films cannot get this right and have one person simply keep track of this number so the reloads and remaining ammunition in these situations seem realistic. 6. He had no magnified optic and instead only a close range holographic sight. A magnified optic combo would have been more realistic and given him a significant advantage over the enemy and made a better film. Instead he only had a slightly more accurate weapon with a quicker ability to acquire a target over his enemy. 7. I will give him credit for not only picking up an enemy\\'s weapon but also a spare magazine something no one ever does in most other films though it would have been better if he picked up more than one. 8. The lead appeared to use very little in the way of tactical sense and only managed one tactical surprise the entire film. 9. This film includes the worst filmed scene of a sniper \"aiming\" I have ever seen. 10. Special Forces Operators attacking an enemy with cover in a tree line, from open ground by walking slowly towards them, standing straight up and yelling each other to stay in a line is something a child dreams up.The special effects were obvious CGI, not the worst I have seen but a few shots were really bad (him falling out of the helicopter, and in one firefight they had the AK muzzle flash about 2 feet away from the barrel). I just hate fake weapon effects and you immediately notice them here but they are workable for much of the film.The worst part however was the use of what appeared to be the same rock outcroppings for three or four scenes where they were supposed to have traveled miles in between. I swear they shot around these same rock formations but simply changed the camera angles. It ruined the entire film\\'s immersion. How hard is it to find an outdoor area, map out a path a few miles long and just walk or drive at least a couple hundred yards along this path between shots?I actually found the sound effects and musical choices to be solid for what this was going for and one of the better aspects of the film.Overall I am disappointed by too much of the film. It honestly had great potential to tell a simple story in a gripping action oriented way with good character development and quick pacing, instead it only hinted at this throughout. The lead could definitely play this role as well as the young girl they simply needed a better director and producer. It is what it is and all I can say is I have seen much worse and much better films.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'In Vietnam the American military establishment consumed an estimated 50,000 rounds of ammunition for every enemy killed.Back in the days before soldiers sprayed bullets about the field of battle promiscuously (i.e. The Civil War) it took about 60 rounds to \"take out\" one enemy soldier. The amount of ammunition used in WW2 resulted in 25,000 rounds per casualty. Usually, you go on a combat patrol with around 210 rounds; If you get into a firefight, your ammunition can deplete very quickly.Yet what we saw in this movie, the frogman, call-sign Warhorse Once wasted his bullets to kill enemies like he had endless supplies of bullets from his logistic arsenal. He usually kept shooting with a salvo of 3 or 4 or even 5 bullets that resulted killing nobody, but when he shot just once, there\\'s a kill. A veteran soldier, alone in the wildness, chased by swarm of enemies should and would never waste his bullets like what we saw in this moronic unrealistic firefights, but he just wasted his bullets so mindlessly generous. It\\'s just made me shake my head non-stop sneering.',\n",

The Gladiator homage scene at the end was worthy of an aloud laugh though.When will movie makers realize that a decent war movie needs more than some airsoft gear and film sets that are blatantly in the US? The Afghan 'baddies', in particular, were hilarious; as if they were from a live action version of Team America.The plot was nonsensical, the dialogue contrived beyond belief, and every attempt to create emotional depth served to provoke a snort of derision.

Then he comes to the rescue of a little girl who is the lone survivor of a family that the SEALs had set out to rescue before they were shot down. The performance from the girl is dull at best.

       "  'comment': 'I was reluctant to give this nine stars because based on the ludicrous number of times Johnny Strong\\'s name appears in the credits, I didn\\'t want to give him an unneeded ego boost. However, as a work of sheer entertainment, this film succeeds admirably.Most of the negative reviews here have to do with military realism. Guess what? This isn\\'t a documentary. Does the hero have a seemingly endless supply of fully loaded magazines? Okay, they cerrainly stretched credibility there... especially when he fired off so many extra rounds more than were necessary.Did that ruin the story? Not for me. I\\'d rather watch a trumped up gunfight in a movie with heart than another invincible martial arts superwarrior running up walls and delivering spinning roundhouse kicks in slow motion and all the other cheeseball choreography that fills the bulk of modern action flicks.As for the long slow second act, yes it could have been trimmed, but I didn\\'t mind the extra screen time with Athena Durner. There are many excellent child actors working these days, but she has incredible appeal and solid chops. And the costumer deserves a nod for turning her into an adorable little waif.Which brings us back to Mr. Strong. He is obviously a major talent who successfully wears many hats and is also very appealing (struck me as Tom Cruise with a dash of Kevin Costner). He\\'s also apparently guilty of the one big flaw I saw in this film.The music he composed is very good and suits the story, but it is way overmixed, drowning out most of the dialog in the first half of the film. And in some scenes even the sounds of nature drowned out the dialog. Luckily we catch just enough to be able to track the story, which isn\\'t very complicated.The action sequences are dynamic and the last act is surprisingly suspenseful. There is no hammy action star posing or cheesy one-liners, and even the borderline action cliches pay off with deft twists.This is simple, exciting entertainment with a charming \"odd couple\" at its center. If you\\'re in the mood for something light (with heavy doses of gunfire) you might want to check it out.',\n",

But I just watched a minute as I had run out of things to view and I was sucked in completely into the vortex of experience that this film creates. I will never forget this film...... it is completely unique and important in its themes.......All the cast is pure magic but where did Athena Durner come from playing 5 year old Zoe Walters with such realism and heart and soul. This is her acting debut and this tiny powerhouse is one to watch.Johnny Strong's portrayal of Master Chief Mirko promises to be a compelling addition to his impressive body of work. Rarely does one see subtle movements and nuances of expression create such a captivating watch. He makes his Directorial debut in this film.There has to be a personal story here - it is just too perfect to be fully imagination. The cinematography, musical score, sweeping scenery, pacing.

All the man needed was to either abort mission and get back to base or find a few missionaries he could help and get them to safety. He had absolutely no business engaging those tangos and attract a man hunt on himself in a terrain he wasn't familiar with.The director of the movie was probably sleeping half the time to waste such good potential. How can you give background music a higher volume than the voice output?

       "  'comment': \"Fast & Furious 9 did what a lot of franchises do at some point: it took the action into outer space. This seemed to me like a good point to call it quits. But with the money still rolling in, nobody in Hollywood was going to end this cash cow; thus we have Fast X, the first in a rumoured three part finale (until the inevitable reboot).I've been on board with the franchise since the start, sticking with it as it moved from the street racing world into more James Bond territory, the action getting more and more ridiculous with each chapter. Seeing how each movie would top the one before in terms of craziness is what kept me entertained. But Fast X is just dumb, and it's not even dumb fun.The stunts are more preposterous than ever, but the film is never thrilling, every interminable action scene enhanced by rather ropey CGI (the flames, in particular, look really bad). There are some dreadful attempts at humour (mostly courtesy of Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris), and we get all that inevitable crap about the importance of family (if I see the gang having another barbecue I think I'll hurl).And then there's Jason Momoa as villain Dante...I can see what they were going for -- kooky flamboyant psycho capable of almost anything -- but Momoa is absolutely awful, his performance bordering on camp, not helped by the character's dubious choice of attire. It's hard to find Dante menacing when he's flouncing about in a silky shirt. I'll no doubt watch the next two films for the sake of completion, but with Momoa on board it'll be hard going.Fast X is easily the weakest of the series so far, but I'll give it 3/10 because I guess things could get even worse.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'By this point, I went to see Fast X without a clue as to what happened in the last one. I think some people went to space.The F&F series is one where villains become friends, people come back from the dead and cars defy the laws of physics. No one has an idea of the story soon after they watched it.A plot inspired by Fast 5, where they stole a safe and rode it along the streets of Rio de Janeiro.Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is the sociopathic son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and he wants to make Dom Toretto and his family suffer for what happened to his dad.The main action starts by dropping a big rolling bomb in Rome and aim it for the Vatican.Plagued with behind the scenes issues. Original director Justin Lin departed soon after shooting started. Director Louis Leterrier does a workmanlike job. As he showed in the Netflix series Lupin, Now You See Me as well as The Transporter movies. He can do car stunts as well as sleight of hand. Some of the CGI looked cheap though.As for Momoa, the director obviously told him. Man you will never play the Joker, too Polynesian. So Dante is your Joker and dial it up to 12. He is loud, camp and is having a ball. Especially with those two IT guys with a funny grin on their faces.Some of the regulars are even more tiresome. A few should had showed up but did not like those two Brazilian guys from the earlier movies. John Cena plays lovable Uncle Jacob, he was the main villain in the last one.The movie actually has four Oscar winning actresses. Not one of them told Vin Diesel how to do dramatic. When Dom had these small tender scenes, I nearly fell asleep.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"The Fast franchise is a movie series that should have faded away a long, long time ago. It started out as a fun but a bit over the top high-octane thrill ride but has descended into the realm of cartoons. With each iteration the action gets increasingly more and more unbelievable. Everybody likes an action film with chases and escapes and fights but what we get here is something like a bad anime in real life. Sure they tried and tried hard to make this movie more spectacular than all the others but one can only shut off their brain for so long. Pushing the boundaries of cinema is one thing but when you throw all sense and reality out the window you get, well this. In the first 5 minutes of the movie I already could tell this was going straight to the Moon with zero plan of how to actually get there. You see Dominic's 8 year old son driving and drifting a muscle car around a parking lot as if he was a pro. Utter ridiculous crap. What's next, to the actual Moon? Or maybe there is a secret bunker in the center of the Earth the team has to infiltrate in order to save the world? Or maybe Dom's car gets a time machine installed in it and they travel back in time to fight Hitler and the SS? I mean, why not? Everything else that happens in this movie is just as plausible. Everyone in Dom's team is an expert at everything and they all seem to be super-human as well. When will this garbage actually end?\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"I have to admit all you people who forewarned me still didn't prepare me for the absolute most ridiculous movie in this franchise & definitely in the top 20 of worst movies ever! Everything was forced, the acting was stale and wooden, nobody seemed to care that they were looking like what they were out there doing! Stroking Vin's ego and not caring how they came across. They were all just going through the motions of a movie with less plot the Wiley Coyote and the Roadrunner. Momoa did a cheap imitation of Ledgers Joker and every part of this movie was just one lifted from 1 or more of the previous 9 movies! The car in outer Space was 10 times better than this 10 year olds version of the Fast & Furious. Fast is just a blatant rip off of Point Break. Walker was Keanu as Johnny Utah, Vin as Swayze's Bohdi. Instead of surfing it's cars and in some they actually rob a bank or two. This movie should never have been made as it contains nothing of what made this group of films popular as they are. The next one hopefully will be the last forever! Whoever gave this more than a 1 has to be somebody related to someone in the movie or a 5 year old! This was so bad that it wasn't even funny and the torment lasted almost 3 hours of non stop chaos and pointless plots with going back and forth between too many storylines that were not connected or understandable! If you don't want to waste 3 hours of your life, skip this and watch Looney Tunes, they are superior in every way!\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Fast X finally went too far.As far as I remember, people keep complaining about this movies being dumb, however, people often dismisses the the charm of the action and the overcomplicated plots of crazy writers trying to show how smart they are. This time they actually went too far.Once again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that weren\\'t there. Once again they got caught on a \"revenge plot\" and once again family has to come together to defeat evil. They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!The whole family is vack qith a brand new cast.Allan Ritchson, I love the guy, but he can\\'t act to save his life. He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie, though.Alison Brie, the second worse actor in the entire movie, has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast. It\\'s actually impressive, she seem uncomfortable in every scene. I don\\'t get it.John Cena again charming his way into making you like his character, he can\\'t act either, but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob Toretto.And Jason Momoa... Just played a goofier Joker. Jared Leto would be proud. He\\'s even obsessed with the color purple. Someone must\\'ve felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of \"I don\\'t wanna kill them, I just want to hurt them real bad\". What a failure of a villain. Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clown.This was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment. Fast 9 shoulda been the last one.Not looking forward to the sequels to this mess, not at all.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'I thought they couldn\\'t possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It\\'s just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it\\'s all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don\\'t even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won\\'t forget Momoa\\'s character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it\\'s worse and Momoa\\'s character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don\\'t have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the \"family\". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real \"family\". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it\\'s the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it\\'s story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It\\'s not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I\\'ve ever seen and they feel like they weren\\'t even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it\\'s just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can\\'t do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it\\'s insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn\\'t care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point. But, this movie sets the lowest bar possible, so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast X\\'s script.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'I am (was) a huge fan of the \"fast and the furious\" series, and of Vin Diesel. Although I am a physicist I can live with \"curbing\" the laws of nature to some extent, provided that this is justified (e.g., through SciFi, magic, alternate universes etc.). It is also OK in movies like Mission Impossible and similar to drive things to the extreme. However, when both physics AND logic go awry it\\'s simply too much.The main villain in the story, (Dante, played by an amazing Jason Mamoa) is simply a joke. He is super intelligent, super rich, super powerful, and a caricature of a sociopath à la Joker. He is able to organize his crimes (which are purely driven by hatred) in such perfect timing across the globe and with access to every possible computer, that his abilities surpass those of Robert Langdon\\'s foes (DaVince code), of Thanos (Avengers) and all James Bonds enemies at once. It borders ridicule. And, the most importantly, makes the film boring.In the next episode they are going probably to have spaceships racing across the galaxy I guess, and Dante will use nuclear fusion to kill.Acting is generally from decent to very good (well it\\'s not Shakespeare after all, so not utterly important), and the cinematography (referring to the effects) excellent. Unfortunately a nice packaging does not salvage a really bad content.Finally, I really abhor cliffhangers, and I seldom (if ever) have seen such an infuriating one. It\\'s one thing to leave things open in a story, and quite a different one to literally stop the action in the middle of the most intense scene, like someone just pulled the plug of the TV. This practically means the producers where so sure the viewer will not watch the next one, that they had to use every means to animate them to do so. Plain awful and tasteless.In a whole this is by far the worst of an otherwise very good series. If you really want to watch it, at least wait until the next one comes out to save yourself the frustration of the unfinished scene.',\n",

Nobody else had ever noticed this. (Much like in our current upside-down age nobody notices the rare earth resources needed to make electric cars the standard). In terms of media ecology, this may be the most wasteful movie produced in decades. The actors, the props, the stunts, all devoted to shutting down a franchise that blew a tire years ago and never got it patched. The sheer incompetence of this script is clear from the character that Momoa tries so hard to breathe life into ... and fails. By the time the Big FInale rolls down the highway, at the 2:00:00 mark, the poor viewer is no longer rooting for the Good Guys or the Bad Guys.

Racing Victors, Racing Heat, Racing Rivals, Racing Independence, Racing Mavericks, Racing Tranquility, Racing Liberty, Racing Bliss, Racing Winners, Racing Explorer, Racing Heaven... and many, many more - and those are just the titles starting with Racing, there are other obvious patterns with different title words.This has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews. I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.\",\n",

It worked and guarantee a sequel but Diesel was not interested so it was replaced by Tyrese Gibson. The movie was highly successful but produces decide to do a cheap one in Tokyo; that end up with a Diesel cameo granting the fourth installment.The fourth part had the original protagonists and made some money; so after a while Diesel become one of the producers and with the higher budget and few spectacular scenes became an absolute blockbuster.That luck lasted for the next four movies; keeping mostly the same cast (minus some dead that came back to life) and strongly villains and spectacular almost realistic scenes.Weil it is not the case here. The only good thing is Momoa doing the bad guy and having fun; and John Cena doing some kind of sympathetic monster.The rest of the cast; as good as usually is; has very little to do; and has little interaction with Diesel.Diesel itself is a complete disaster. He barely act and is basically Superman; it was a thief originally but now became a generous loving person who only cares about his family and friends.Louis Leterrier and usually good action movie director used to lower budget movies; does not seems confortable with this one.The special effects are very poor; that last sequences is really lame and very cheap made and the movie is overload with fight sequences and very little cars ones. In fact the most spectaculars are the ones showed from FF 5 a few times during this movie.To make matters worse; the script is absurd; overly long (141 minutes) and the movie has no ending; leaving open for X2 or XIIn brief; do not lose your time; is obviously the intention was to squeeze the franchise make some extra bucks but at least should have try to keep the level of the previous movies.',\n",

But let's try to stay positive and start with a good point.The opening is probably the best part of the movie so make sure you enjoy it. Additionally, all the scenes with Jacob were surprisingly good and funny where on the other hand the scenes with Roman and Tej aren't that funny anymore. Also you need to stay till the Post credit scene. I would say it's worth the wait.But enough good things. The story is very bad. Normally, the action compensates the bad story but this is not the case here because the action is also one of the worst we have seen in a Fast & Furious movie yet combined with even worse VFX. Furthermore, the cars should be a very important aspect of the movie but no, not in this one. The cars play a pretty small part and are just there so they can call it a Fast & Furious movie. Also the movie is too long. We only see bad action after bad action and then learn about how a new character is related to this whole family, just boring.And the most important question: Are the scenes realistic? Not really but after we have seen a car in Space the scenes are relatively realistic.With this movie Universal just wanted to make money but completely forgets about us fans. After we watched it we are forced to watch the next one and spend even more money which is just too bad. Well, I think that was everything and I hope you enjoyed this review.\",\n",

Perhaps I could even devise a less profanity-laden diatribe of how awful this film was and approach it in a state of zen.The walk worked a tad but when I started writing I could feel the seeth start anew. The endless cliched dialog recycled from countless other films, the stale humor way past its expiration date, the ok action sequences that were better done in previous Fast and furious films. The Ending... all of these intertwined to leave a rancid taste in my mouth.Even the parts of the film that worked (Jason Momoa makes for a reasonably fun villain, Statham is always a joy to watch doing his thing) are fleeting, in the later's case his part is much to small, in the former the long bloated runtime dillutes his appeal somewhatIs it an all together AWFUL film? Nope not really. It is what it is. Is it a vast disappointing outing for the series? YESD (me being generous)TLDR: Go on keep milking the franchise for every last drop and see how many of us say F it and merely wait for streaming.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Do you remember the game people used to play where someone would write down the first line of a story on a piece of paper, fold it back so the next person couldn't see it and then they'd add another line, fold it back etc. Then at the end you'd read the story in full and laugh at the results? Well I think that's how Fast X was written. It's a mish-mash of the previous 9 films rolled into one with cameo appearances from almost anyone who's ever starred in any of them. The problem is the story is nonsensical - we have jumps to shoots all around the world for no reason at all. We have a few maudlin scenes from the past. And of course (this is not a spoiler as it's now everywhere in the press) Fast X is not in fact the last film of the franchise so there is no closure of any sort at the end. The cast felt tired, going through the motions. I think even they think there's maybe been too many movies in this franchise. The only saving grace here was the wonderfully over the top villain played brilliantly by Jason Momoa - every scene he was in stood out.Yes there's the usual over the top stunts (though personally I thought not as good as some of the previous films) racing for no real point, fight scences etc so the fans of the franchise will probably enjoy it. But as a standalone film and even in comparison with the previous 9, it's a bit of a mess.\",\n",

I watched because I was drunk and bored but this crossed all lines. I can't imagine what money actor get to play this, but there's no family or fans or whatever - this is a shame recorded for money.

       "  'comment': \"Fast X (2023)The Fast and Furious franchise has become the topic of endless jokes whether it's the nonsensical plots, Bollywood rivalling action or the obsession with FaMiLy. While they did have their moments, after part 5, the reason why I watched these films was to roast the stupidity with my friends and hopefully to get some enjoyment out of it. Everytime I wondered what science defying spectacle they were going to shock me with but sadly this time, everything was rather normal by the standards of the franchise.In Fast X, the family of racers turned secret agents goes up against a new omnipotent villain named Dante who is a hybrid of Mugatu From Zoolander, Tom Hardy's Charles Bronson and Jared Leto's Joker. Dante is on a mission to make Dom suffer but over the course of the movie, it's the audience who ends up suffering the most. Unlike the predecessors, there weren't any cool elements, enjoyable fight sequences or laughable moments to make the experience worth suffering through. Considering that cars are a superpower of the franchise, there weren't enough car related sequences either.Even though there is an action sequence with blasting music every 5 minutes, I actually felt bored most of the time. On one side it's the general cacophony of the events and poor VFX while on the other, it's the lack of this logic defying craziness that I have come to expect. When I wasn't bored, I was cringing from the dialogue and painful head splitting humor. Oh, and when did John Cena go from a cold blooded murderer to a fun loving uncle?Fast X is a pure set up for the sequels as the story dashes between geographical locations while shoving too many characters and giving some of them around 3 minutes of screen time. I have obliterated the past 4 movies in my reviews but I have never been bored while watching them. It's neitehr grounded like the first four movies nor is it over-the-top like the next five. Better than Fast Nine but still hazardous to the human brain.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.\",\n",

I think it's Vin Diesel that starts to get so annoying and so smug with the whole script around his character, the old same quotes and ''the family'' always being pronounced without any emotion capable of revealing the slightest talent as an actor.John Cena was an extra to help me follow the movie almost till the end. Jason Mamoa was very refreshing and devilishly funny. But both soon started to lose their characters in such script so poorly structured.Jason Statham would have done better than the ''star'' who persists in being the center of the attention of the world wich seems to be always against him.The script seems to have jumped from writer to writer with several sequences that seems to only serve to fill time and film, but without contributing much to the continuity and outcome of the story.A disappointment for anyone who would have expected something more exciting.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"I buckled up for the latest instalment in the adrenaline-fueled franchise, Fast X. Having previously enjoyed the well-made escapist nonsense of this franchise, I eagerly anticipated this action-packed joyride. But the reality falls short of the high-octane thrills and heart-racing moments we've enjoyed during this long-running, beloved series. Directed by a new visionary, Fast X struggles to find its footing, leaving me with a disjointed and lacklustre experience.Though intended to be the cornerstone of the film, the plot feels convoluted and overstuffed. The narrative attempts to tie up loose ends from previous entries, resulting in a tangled web of unresolved storylines and contrived twists. The themes of loyalty, family, and redemption, which once resonated deeply, are now lost amidst the chaos of overblown action sequences and cheesy dialogue.Unfortunately, the once-charismatic characters we've grown to love seem to be mere shadows of their former selves. The lacklustre performances by the ensemble cast dampen the film's impact, leaving me yearning for the chemistry and charisma that once made this franchise shine. The newcomers fail to make a lasting impression, and their interactions feel forced, lacking the organic camaraderie we expect from a Fast and Furious film.While attempting to inject fresh energy into the series, the direction falters in execution. The pacing is erratic, with frenetic action scenes abruptly juxtaposed with moments of forced sentimentality. The director's attempts to reinvent the franchise fall flat, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.The score, cinematography, and production design, once standout elements of the Fast and Furious films, fail to leave a lasting impact. The familiar pulsating beats and slick visuals that defined the series are noticeably absent, replaced by generic choices that fail to elevate the overall experience. The special effects, too, lack the finesse and attention to detail we've come to expect, leaving action scenes feeling artificial and detached.The editing further exacerbates the film's issues with jarring cuts and questionable transitions. Scenes that should have heightened the tension instead fall flat, as the editing fails to maintain a cohesive flow. The dialogue, filled with clichés and uninspired one-liners, adds little depth to the already weak characterisations, leaving me longing for the witty banter and memorable lines that once made these films a guilty pleasure.While Fast X attempts to recapture the essence of what made this franchise a global phenomenon, it falls short in almost every aspect. As a viewer, I felt a palpable sense of disappointment, longing for the days when these films delivered heart-pounding action and captivating storytelling. It pains me to say that Fast X fails to leave a lasting impact, leaving me questioning the franchise's future.Fast X is a lacklustre entry in the series, struggling to find its place amidst a convoluted plot, underwhelming performances, and a misguided attempt at reinvention. Despite its best intentions, the film fails to deliver the thrills and emotional resonance that made its predecessors successful. Fast X is a forgettable and disjointed experience that falls far behind the high standards set by the franchise-strap in for a disappointing ride.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Does it live up to the hype?Unfortunately, the answer is no. Fast X is a disappointing and nonsensical mess that fails to entertain or impress. The plot is thin and convoluted, the characters are bland and forgettable, and the logic is nonexistent. The film relies on cheap CGI, unrealistic physics, and ridiculous coincidences to create its spectacle, but it only succeeds in creating eye-rolling moments and disbelief.The film's biggest flaw is its lack of realism and consistency. The film expects us to believe that Dominic Toretto and his team can survive anything, from driving down stairs, to jumping out of planes, to falling off dams, without a scratch. They can also outrun and outsmart the police, the military, and a global terrorist organization with ease. They can hack into any system, use any weapon, and drive any vehicle with no training or preparation. They can also defy the laws of nature, such as gravity, momentum, and thermodynamics, with their cars and gadgets.The film also expects us to care about the characters and their relationships, but it fails to develop them or give them any depth. The film introduces characters, such as Jakob Toretto (Dominic's long-lost brother) and Gisele (a former ally who was presumed dead), but they are poorly written and acted. The film also brings back characters, such as Cipher (the main villain from the previous film) and Letty (Dominic's wife), but they are reduced to clichés and stereotypes. The film tries to create drama and tension between them, but it feels forced and artificial.The film also tries to be funny and witty, but it falls flat. The film's humor relies on lame jokes, awkward banter, and childish insults that are not funny or clever. The film also tries to be cool and badass, but it comes off as cheesy and cringy. The film's soundtrack is generic and forgettable, the dialogue is corny and predictable, and the action scenes are over-the-top and boring.Fast X is a waste of time and money. It is a poorly made film that insults the intelligence and taste of its audience. It is a film that should be avoided by anyone who values quality cinema or entertainment. It is a film that deserves a rating of 1 out of 10 stars.\",\n",

But the funniest thing is that this same company, or at least, another branch of this same company has a whole slew of live-action series under their belt in the Tokusatsu department, superhero series to be precise, that they don't want to release to the general populace in the west because they think only japanese people are interested in those, when in reality the likes of Super Sentai, Kamen Rider, Metal Heroes etc. Etc. Etc. Would be immensely beneficial to people tired to death of MCU and DCEU garbage, and they would actually profit more by giving a proper release to those instead of letting fansubbers doing all the work for them! Nope, this is what the corporate suits envisioned for us western fans, this and the last unnecessary movies of the useless Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon remake. What the hell happened to this company?

Upon more thorough check, this is HK's production, that's why the martial art fight got more budget. The writer didn't understand what the story was about, the actors looked like idiots in costumes, the senior actors had no clue what their characters meant, and worse they produced this ridiculous monstrosity.The Pegasus and Phoenix costumes were good at a glance, until you look at them carefully and see that these guys use Chinese war armors instead of Zodiac knight's costumes.

And then.... they blew it sky high.Instead of Saint Seiya, they gave us a Dark Phoenix rip off.... literally. From Famke Jansenn as Guradd (remind me again who that is in anime?!) to Sienna's (that's right, they changed the name from Saori to Sienna) nightmares about how she will destroy the world, and the final battle that copies the X-Men: Dark Phoenix (2006) from frames to frames. Seiya apparently could healed his wounds too, just like Wolverine does. What the.....Blasphemy 5/10Spoiler: Sean Bean did die in this movie.\",\n",

I understand that not everything can be like in the anime or manga, but these dolts who constantly make live actions cannot stick to the basic lore EVER and they fail to understand that it's the stoy and the backstories, character development and replationships that drew in the fans to ANIME AND MANGA and those people should be their target audience and not the normies who, btw, think this is garbage. Visual efects are meh but I would endure it if the story was acceptable but it wasn't. It's basically Jean Grey creating her army of cosmo mutants to hunt down Athena. I won't even mention the butchering of plot and other characters, and if you're interested in Sean Bean or Mackenyu go watch some better movies with them.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"A Saint Seiya fan since 1991, I knew going in that this movie would differ from the source material. The trailers were clear enough. A faithful adaptation, I did not expect. But maybe there was a decent film in there, with some elements of the original manga/anime. While not a trainwreck, a good movie this is not.So how much does it stray? Well, there *are* some callbacks to the original IP. A few notes in the musical score, taken straight from the anime soundtrack. Some visuals that made my heart skip a beat, including the very first, somewhat misleading scene. They are all too few, though. This is not the Saint Seiya we grew up with.The armors are way too different - and not particularly appealing. The fighting scenes, heavy in martial arts, guns, and military vehicles, are not what the original series was all about. Hard to tap into nostalgia when you turn your back on 90% of what people liked in the first place. But again, the main trouble lies in the story.It's bland. The characters are poorly written. Their arcs, poorly developed. Key scenes late in the movie are laughable, including some that were supposed to be poignant. It's not altogether surprising: rather than adapt the 80's masterpiece, this movie is based on the more recent Netflix adaptation, which flopped commercially and critically.The film's about a young man struggling to accept his destiny as a knight while spouting that nobody's fate is predetermined and the reincarnated goddess he's supposed to protect, a spunky young girl who lived in fear of being unable to control her immense power, in a rehash of the (also poorly adapted) Dark Phoenix saga from the X-Men.It feels all-too familiar, especially with Famke Janssen (Jean Grey in the X-Men movies) overlooking the action as the movie's antagonist. There's also Sean Bean (LOTR, GOT, etc.) and Marc Dacascos (Crying Freeman, John Wick 3) in there, but everyone's acting is flat throughout. Hard to shine with the run of the mill story and dialogue.As for newer faces, Mackenyu looks the part, but there's something lacking. You feel he may have done a better job with more decent lines. Madison Iseman as Sienna showed some charisma, but she too fell victim to the plot holes and inconsistent behavior that plague her and all the other characters.Could the sequel, with the expected introduction of some key characters, come closer to evoking the thrills the original story did? Perhaps, but I doubt they'll get the chance to do so after botching the launch of what was expected to be a multi-picture saga. Then again, I'm not confident this creative team could have done a good job at it.No, this is not Dragonball Evolution. The glimpses - teases, really - we get of the original Saint Seiya hint at what could have been a great film. The action scenes are well-choreographed and the main two characters, sympathetic enough. It's all 100% watchable, but nobody's recommending it to anyone, and it will be forgotten soon.It's a shame. You had some great source material. You could have gotten an awesome movie out of it. Why the lack of faith in it? I came away disappointed and suspect many others will, as well. You want to like or at least enjoy it, but you just end up frustrated at the missed opportunity.(+) A select few callbacks to the original manga and anime, particularly at the very beginning, in the training scenes, and for a few seconds in the movie's climax. Some actions scenes are decent, albeit heavy in martial arts.(-) Spotty plot. Lousy third act. Bland characters and storylines taken straight from Netflix's poorly received adaptation. Movie really strays from the source material to tell a rather unoriginal story - and tell it poorly, to boot.\",\n",

Films like the Seventh Son, Gods Of Egypt, and Jupiter Ascending came to mind whilst watching this. Although I'll always defend Jupiter Ascending, as I thought it was a great time at the movies.However, this is a different kettle of Special Effects.We start with Sean Bean giving us a Basil Exposition voice over for people who are not savvy with the source (I'd never heard of it) and then we are thrown into the ring with our main character and Nick Stahl who is channeling Vinnie Jones' Juggernaut from X-Men: Last Stand.We learn that Sean Bean is related to a goddess who glows when she is angry, and Famke Janssen is on the bad guy side, as she has the ninja stormtroopers with her all the time.And that's the film. It's rubbish, and even though the special effects are quite good in some instances, it cannot hide the fact that there is nothing much going on except our main character does some training, and gets something to make him look like a cross dresser.Stupid.\",\n",

His training with Marin is done well and the first fights that don't have the armor are nicely choreographed but everything else is terrible.I couldn't care more about Famke's character, her motivations are so shallow together with Ikki, who is there mainly so there's a final fight. We have Mitsumasa who isn't Mitsumasa. The VFX looks straight from a 2012 PS3 game. There are so many futuristic ships I didn't know if the movie was supposed to be an alternative world or 20 years in the future.But the main thing for me is that the movie didn't feel like Saint Seiya, it was like someone who saw the anime 30 years ago tried to explain it to a Hollywood producer who didn't bother to watch the original content and stick to the description given to him. In the end it didn't have the sense of humanity against gods and the sense that even when Seiya lost all his senses he would never give up.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'I am not part of the target audience for this movie. Keep that in mind.If someone made a movie about the ancient Greek Gods for the 21st Century, and used Asian martial arts action cinematic techniques, then this would be the movie they made. And they did.The soundtrack is loud and obnoxious. All of the dialogue is ego-oriented; i.e. \"Listen to how clever I am.\" And the fights scenes are out of late night Kung Fu fare from the 1980s.For all that, it\\'s technically a competent film like all big budget films, but it\\'s agenda is about letting female energy reign in spite of a lot of hijinks by the males, ironically led by a female character., and it\\'s a female instructor that teaches the main protagonist how to fight.So ... it\\'s pretty cliche and predictable, but is it a bad movie? Eh, I\\'m not really partial to it, I could see all the plot points and story oriented character moments coming a mile away, including the whole \"date outside your social circle\" motif, and the feminine angle regarding the responsibility of wielding power and who should and why.It\\'s a film made for teens and so-called \"geek culture\". I gave it a chance, and all I can say is that I liked it better than the first Guardians of the Galaxy, but again this is a movie made for the teen comic-book crowd, and not for an older individual like me.Loud, over the top, predictable, lots of ego oriented moments, if you\\'re looking for some updated martial-arts action with god like powers thrown in, then look no further than this movie.

The sacrifice. The pain, and the darkness that lies within the hearts of people that would take children and destroy their souls and lives.I give this movie a high rating because it wasn't just a good movie, it was a wake up call to all people that there are atrocities occurring everyday towards children and it needs to stop.

I admire Tim Ballard and James Caviezel's dedication to this plight. Caviezel did an amazing acting job-as always. Was I uncomfortable during parts of the movie? I was, and everyone should be!! There is nothing graphic, but you understand what's happening. We need to be more aware of these things and be watchful and alert with our own children and all children!! For this reason I recommend that you see this movie. It will help us all to be more vigilant. Beyond that, it was entertaining and held our attention for what is usually considered a very long movie.\",\n",

If you have children, I suggest you have them watch with you because everybody needs to wake up to what is going on in this world! AN's children need to be very aware of their surrounding. I know it's scary, but better safe than sorry IMO. Im sad to know that in our country, of these United States, we are some of the worlds worst! Although this movie is absolutely heartbreaking, it also gives you a little bit of hope. Because we know God is with us, but also we know there are some really good people out there trying to make a change. Putting their lives on the line, putting their families in danger whether it be because their mom or dad is not coming home because they lay their life on the line to save somebody else's child, or they're made as cops/informants and families are killed. They are all heroes! I wondered as I was sitting in the theater watching this movie...in the two hours I was there I wondered how many children were trafficked or how many were sexually abused. It is absolutely heartbreaking and it is very real.\",\n",

They are being exposed to the underbelly of an utterly evil system of child bondage beyond imagining. Like it's shown to us by the relative indifference that any have, we also become desensitized to level of horror these children must endure. The shameless reprobates who feed into this diabolical machination, resulting in unmitigated genocide of our children...I guess we just don't get it. I know I'm truly stricken with the heaviness of it all, and yet where is our enthusiasm? Who will stand up for those who cannot defend themselves, the humblest and most innocent ones?

Very bold, probably even bold enough to keep people from seeing it. The subject matter being what it is, the movie still has a story to tell. Admittedly, it was a difficult story to get through and rightfully it was centered around those brave enough, and willing enough to do a job not many can handle for any length of time. People that are dedicated enough, and willing enough to risk their lives to confront such crimes, and to confront those perpetrating such crimes surely deserve our thanks. But, the people portrayed in this movie are nothing short of heroic and deserve more than our thanks.It's based on a true story and enough to motivate some to shake the hand of any police officer and tell them to keep up the good work. And, maybe we can do more. Maybe we can spread the word to go see this movie. Is seeing the movie enough? The movie does an excellent job at handling an uncomfortable subject while truly uncovering a shockingly huge and increasingly growing problem. Not many could be aware that slavery today is bigger and more profitable than it was when it was legal. How can that be? The movie is an eye opener.The movie has uncomfortable moments, but handles it in a mature way. The movie is inspiring in how the actors, playing the part of real live heroes, give you a glimpse of what's happening and what can be done. It might even be worth seeing the caliber of actor in Jim Caviezel giving a portrayal with such an emotional range of someone working a very difficult job, and willing to give it his all.There are shake-your-head moments where surely the characters in this story are going to die, but they still push forward. Just crazy what some can do if they have the determination and the backbone to give it a go.Muster the courage to see this one if you can, though it may stick with you for some time. Then, go shake the hand of your local cop.\",\n",

No one should tolerate the atrocities depicted. However, despite our individual feelings of powerlessness to stop human trafficking and slavery, I appreciate this film for compelling society to face these horrifying truths.However, I was taken aback by the lack of emotional depth in the movie. There was no substantial exploration of human emotions in the depiction of these grave issues. The narrative felt unreal, with every element so oversimplified that the film became intolerable around halfway through.

A lot of what happens in this movie isn't true but we all know Hollywood does that a lot. There's hard to watch scenes that make your stomach turn. They go almost too far showing stuff on screen then cut it off just in time. Which begs the question, this stuff could have just been implied? That aside this movie is a mess. It's cut up so choppy, like a play almost. The transitions aren't smooth, we jump scene to scene for the first hour and a half of the movie. The acting isn't the worst in the world but the main actor, Jim Caviezel, delivers a poor performance that makes the surrounding cast look like Oscar performances (they're not). There's random humor sprinkled in the film that is just so out of place, there's scenes where they try some sort of fancy cinematography that drags out and feels like they forgot to cut the film. I guess the best way to describe this movie is similar to a lifetime movie. It's choppy, messy and a fabricated truth of a movie. The best part is the special message when Caviezel says they basically couldn't get the movie out because of Hollywood but then they do the Hollywood thing of making Tim Ballard look like a crazy badass by making up the whole climax of the film.This is a below average film about a serious topic matter.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'It\\'s honestly absurd how good the \"Spider-Verse\" movies are. \"Across the Spider-Verse\" is just as great, if not better than \"Into the Spider-Verse\". I really don\\'t know how. \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen\\'s story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham\\'s Captain Stacy are truly special.Can\\'t wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn\\'t want to blink because I didn\\'t want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn\\'t expecting.\"Across the Spider-Verse\" is another milestone for animation. Yes it\\'s gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen\\'s story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it\\'s visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie\\'s real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.What more can I say...It\\'s an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It\\'s outstanding. \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It\\'s darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.',\n",

This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people.\",\n",

It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn\\'t have \"Part One\" in the title. It doesn\\'t really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it\\'s kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can\\'t wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of \"Into the Spider-Verse\", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it\\'s crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I\\'m even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn\\'t been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can\\'t take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can\\'t wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it\\'s hard to judge before seeing the next one. There\\'s a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it\\'s awesome. It\\'s still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"LIKES:The Pace For The Most Part\\n-Comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and Miles' next story.. has A LOT to tell.-It found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.-Yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.-This dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.-That takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.The Voice Acting\\n-Everyone rocks in this movie, and I have to agree with my friend that it is grade A on many levels with what you get in live action movies.-Isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.The Storytelling\\n-There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.-It's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn't CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.The Comedy To A degree\\n-I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.The Nostalgia and Easter Eggs\\n-Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.-Then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.The Action Scenes\\n-A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.The Animation/Art Style\\n-You've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.DISLIKES:The Comedy A Bit Too Forced\\n-There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.Some Pacing Offsets\\n-There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.-At least until the need.The Ending 20 minutes for me\\n-The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.The Sound Quality With Some Characters\\n-It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.The VERDICT:\\nOverall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0-9.5\\nMovie Overall: 8.5.\",\n",

It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It's richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :THE ARTWORK.This films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.If this doesn't win the Oscar for best animated feature I'm rioting, and you'd better join me. GO AND SEE THIS FILM RIGHT NOW.\",\n",

Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler.

I have honestly never witnessed such remarkable animation as in \"Across the Spider-Verse.\" The visuals are breathtaking, featuring a wide array of styles. It is a true multiverse experience, with an abundance of captivating details in every frame, including numerous Easter eggs and a vibrant color palette. I found myself not wanting it to end, despite its substantial length. Knowing that the next part will be released in 2024 brings me immense joy because waiting a few more years to see how this story unfolds would be agonizing.The story is exceptionally well-crafted, expanding upon the existing characters while introducing new ones and incorporating intriguing twists.

       "  'comment': 'I absolutely loved 2018\\'s \"Into the Spider-Verse\". It not only earned its \"Best Animated Picture\" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn\\'t help but walk away just saying the film was...good.Given the film\\'s stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a \"part 1\" and ends on a \"To Be Continued...\". I don\\'t think that\\'s a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as \"Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1\". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like \"Two Towers\", \"Empire Strikes Back\" or \"Back to the Future part 2\", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can\\'t give this full marks considering the story could end like the series \"Lost\" and completely undermined the whole journey.With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.The \"fan service\", \"Easter Eggs\" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don\\'t have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn\\'t all reliant on a single person for their humor.And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in \"Kung Fu Panda\". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can\\'t give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don\\'t let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they made it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion it's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.Visually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are watching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"I was really blown away by this masterpiece. It's beautiful, clever, funny and deep. And it dares being a comics in each and every frame. It never allows you to forget these are drawn characters you see. Unlike so many animated movies of recent time it doesn't go for the smooth polished look it makes certain we never forget that we watch a comics book that was brought to life on screen. Just like Rembrandt made sure we all see his brush strokes when we watch his paintings. But just like Rembrandt, it's done without allowing the technical mastery of it all to drop one little bit. But it's way more than simple issue of the looks of it. This is comics all the way, thematically as well as visually, hence the ending we got.They didn't give up on anything; didn't allow a single detail to go amiss. They wouldn't give up on any bit of storytelling. It's all there, no matter how long the final cut will be, and still, it's not too long not even a second too long. The characters are all fully developed - real human beings drawn in comics form, but human just like any of us watching them on screen. It calls for some of the best voice acing I've seen, by each and every member of the cast. I simply can't single out anyone of them. They were all superb.And than the story itself - It's way more than just sci-fi comics. It doesn't limit itself to the usual issues of power and its moral implications. It's asking us the deep questions of what determines the path our life take? Are we ruled by our destiny? Is it all written in our stars? If I had a problem with most of the comics I read it was because of the fatalistic approach adopted by most of them. This one defies the tradition in the best way. It breaks down all the accepted rules and leaves us all hanging in one of the best cliff hangers ever.If you love comics, science fiction, action movies or simply real brilliant cinema - go see it.\",\n",

It pushes the boundaries of animated movies and does it with style. The voice acting is good. The movie respects and pays homage to spider-man lore whilst offering something fresh (hard to pull off). Almost all the side characters feel real and fleshed out - even those with minimal screen time.The bad: It's most definitely a middle chapter and the film suffers for it. The movie is long, the pacing suffers, and scenes feel drawn out - which makes sense when you understand it's not trying to reach the end. The movie 'finishes' literally in the middle of a plot beat - when it didn't need to. Empire Strikes Back has shown us how it's done. It feels like pure marketing/money making tactics. A shame.Should you watch it: If you like Into the Spider-Verse - most definitely. The film pays homage to spider-man (both on and off screen) while offering something new. It's also just a brilliantly made animated film. Highly recommended.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'SCORE: 10/10I am still processing this storytelling masterpiece. Before I get into the review, huge shoutout to my cousin for being an Associate Editor on this project. It was so amazing seeing his name, R. Chett Hoffman, in the credits. Such a proud and inspirational moment. He will go down in cinema history for helping create one of, if not the greatest animated movie of all time.When I say greatest animated movie of all time, I\\'m not saying that from a story perspective. I\\'m saying it while taking into account both the story and the animation style. The story was still fantastic and crafted well, but something like Toy Story is just going to be hard to beat for me, which is just personal preference at the end of the day. For a comic book movie, you can\\'t get any better animation style put to screen. It\\'s innovative, way ahead of its time, and unlike anything I\\'ve ever seen. Once Miles shows up to the place that the rest of the Spider-People are, the story takes a completely different form. It goes from setup to every Spider-Man fan\\'s dream. It truly had something in there for everyone. Not only were the cameos and use of the Spider-World very well thought out and effective, but the plot of the movie finally comes together and reveals the meaning behind everything that has been going on.When I saw the canon thing show up on Gwen\\'s watch, I was confused at first. It\\'s probably the dyslexic in me, but I was thinking cannon like the weapon. Once Miguel started explaining Miles\\' place in all of this and how each Spider-Man story has followed a canon story, it all made sense to me. You hear the word canon thrown around a lot in a franchise to ask if certain projects are \"canon\" to the bigger story being told. Using Uncle Ben\\'s death as the main focus point of the canon was genius, which allowed them to include the coolest cameos of the entire film in Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. There were so many more, but those 2 stuck out to me, just like the other ones did for people who had connections with the other Spider-People. One connection we all shared was with the group formed in Into The Spider-Verse, which all came back in a big way. All of these amazing cameos and references made the story fun and exciting, but it wasn\\'t what made it the most meaningful.The most meaningful part of the story was discovering that Miles wasn\\'t supposed to be bit in the first place, and that he was the first ever anomaly. From that moment on, everything starts to come together and make sense, with twists and turns in the story happening one after another. That is, until we are brought to the biggest twist of them all. Miles travels back to the Earth that originally contained the spider that bit him, Earth-42. With the absence of Spider-Man, was Miles just a normal kid? What things unfolded by having the canon broken in this Universe? We find out that the Prowler still lives, but the identity of the Prowler is unknown. That leaves us to the ultimate cliffhanger for Part 1, where it is revealed that Miles had become the Prowler in that Universe. Seeing the duality of Miles as Spider-Man and the Prowler was the PERFECT way to leave us wanting more and to cap off this amazing film. I know that will be up for debate until we see Beyond the Spider-Verse, which comes out at the end of March 2024, but I thought it was an awesome twist.To be fair, the first part of the movie started off really slow. The length of time Miles was at odds with his parents and concealing his identity lasted too long. It was important to set the scene, but I feel like the beginning dragged on for longer than it needed to. That\\'s literally the only bad thing I can say about it. Everything else was perfect and I think it is better than the original, only by a little. It was beautiful, it was breath taking, and it was mastery on full display.',\n",

The film is plagued by pacing issues, a reliance on clichés, and a lack of focus.The film's biggest problem is its length. At two hours and twenty minutes, it feels like two movies crammed into one. The first half of the film is slow and meandering, with too many subplots that don't really go anywhere. The second half of the film is much better, but it still feels rushed.Another issue with the film is its reliance on clichés. The theme of family is particularly overused, and it doesn't really add anything new to the story. The film also suffers from some pacing issues, with some scenes feeling too long and others feeling too short.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor.\",\n",

Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from the beginning of the movie! (during Gwen's 20 minute opening.) By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one. I think the wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it's just not. It doesn't live up to the greatness of it's predecessor. Hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!\",\n",

I\\'d definitely suggest seeing this at the cinema because the use of colours and the work which has gone into the animations is undoubtedly the highlight, I actually can\\'t think of a more visually creative movie I\\'ve seen. Great soundtrack too, and quite funny. One of my criticisms is it\\'s got that \"Deadpool\" kind of style where literally everything is tongue in cheek, it needed more genuinely serious scenes just to break it up. Like there are these big arguments and then a joke is thrown in half way through, who does that? Also it\\'s got quite bad dialogue but it\\'s a family superhero movie so I went in expecting that, only a minor point really.Real rating - 7/10: it\\'s half a movie man!! It\\'s a part 1, and I feel a bit cheated that I went in not knowing that. There was commotion in the cinema when it ended, a lot of people were annoyed. I just don\\'t get this trend in cinema, for me a great movie needs to be able to stand on its own. 2h30 is plenty of time to tell a compelling story without ending on a cliffhanger. Think the plot would\\'ve been better suited to a series format - it\\'s already kind of like a high budget Arcane in feel - but obviously that wouldn\\'t work with the first movie and it wouldn\\'t make as much money. To make it a great movie they should\\'ve dissolved one of the sub plots and actually finished it.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first of a two part movie. These studios should be legally required to put \"part 1\" in the title. Fast X did the same thing and I felt unsatisfied when the movie abruptly ends with everything completely unresolved.Now Across the Spider-Verse endlessly better, but I still had that unsatisfied feeling when I realized I was watching the first half of a really long movie. So much is set up in the first act, including a cool villain, and is left completely unresolved.Think about your favorite movies. Now imagine that when you saw them for the first time, someone cut it off halfway through and made you wait a year for the rest. A movie needs to be able to stand on its own.Aside from that, I pretty much love this movie. I don\\'t think it\\'s as good as the original, but that\\'s a high bar. The animation is incredible, especially during a long intro scene in a different universe. There are so many different styles and techniques. The characters are awesome, as are the ideas in this story.My only real issue is that the story felt a little messy and all over the place. But that made way more sense when I realized it was half of a movie. That\\'s why we\\'re still getting setup and introducing conflicts late in the movie. We\\'ll have to wait and see how the second part pulls it all together. I also found the sound a little low during the action scenes and sometimes had trouble hearing the dialogue, even in Dolby Atmos.I already can\\'t wait to see the next one. And if it does everything right, I can see myself raising the score for this one. I had a great time with Across the Spider-Verse. I also feel a bit unsatisfied.EDIT: On second viewing, I feel the same. It\\'s awesome, but it\\'s not complete.

By the end of this it felt like they were dragging it out and I had lost interest quite some time previously. The animation is good but sometimes less is more, and there was less differentiation between the styles, I don't think bill sienkiewicz was involved in this one. I remember my emotions building in the first one, peaking when what's up danger kicked in in the soundtrack, but this got into some schlocky emotional teen drama territory that made me yawn. I also felt it was a bit cynical to split it in two, I'm sure the full story could have been told in one movie which would have upped the quality of the animation too. Then there was the sense of universal danger overload that this and other stories revert to to ramp up the drama; whether a universe or every parallel universe and it's uncle is at stake, who cares, trying to make it bigger than before doesn't increase drama, that comes from character and plot development, yeah, like it did in the first one. It needed more jokes too, nowhere near as funny as the last time.\",\n",

The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome.

       "  'comment': \"The first three John Wick films came in fairly quick succession, with only five years between the first and third chapters, each film trying to top the one before in terms of wild set pieces. For me, it all became a bit too much, the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three), I had had enough.I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything, I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes, as technically excellent as they are, simply don't know when to quit, and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga), seemingly impervious to pain and injury, meaning that the character is never in any real peril, which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything, the relentless action scenes result in boredom, being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help).Director Chad Stahelski pushes plausibility way beyond breaking point with a protracted melee amidst the traffic around the Arc De Triomphe that somehow fails to attract the attention of the Paris gendarmerie; an even more dumb scene (in a film packed with dumb scenes) sees nightclub revellers continuing to dance while people are being shot and axed to death all around them. The final act - a duel between John and blind warrior Caine (Donnie Yen) - takes place outside the Basilica of Sacré-Coeur de Montmartre at dawn, with not a single tourist or passerby to alert the authorities of what is occurring.I've been known to enjoy comic-book action films that aren't exactly grounded in reality, but John Wick 4 seems to take place in an alternate universe where none of our rules apply. Since very little of what we see in this film can be believed, I definitely don't swallow the idea that John Wick is actually dead at the end (although I sincerely hope he is).Those claiming that this is the best action film ever made have clearly never seen The Raid 2 (or any early John Woo film, or The Night Comes For Us, or Ong-Bak, or Born To Fight, or Eastern Condors or In The Line of Duty IV or.... well, you get the idea).\",\n",

The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it.The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no.The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else.I give this a very, very generous 3/10. If you want to watch this, don't. Go watch the first one, and maybe the second one instead. Those are also highly stupid, but at least decently entertaining, this is not.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. \"Parabellum\" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.',\n",

I felt it lacked a decent storyline and was 2 hours and 35 mins of fighting while the remaining 10 or so minutes was acting.The usual far too long fighting scenes where he does his usual MMA moves by getting the enemies head between his legs while he reloads his gun and shoots him the head.For me it was at least an hour too long and could have been much shorter. The storyline was very weak and after such a long gap between this and John Wick 3 I am surprised it was written better.I also have no idea why this review has to be a minimum go 600 characters?Yes we.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"In this fourth installment of 8711's successful franchise, Keanu Reeves wearily drags himself from setpiece to setpiece, saying little, surviving the most ridiculous setups and finally achieves nothing.The acting and writing of JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 are indeed the worst aspects of this film, and the exaggerated runtime of almost three hours doesn't help.Try to remember John Wick's motivation to do all the things he does. What exactly is he actually doing, escpecially in this one? In addition to a lack of motivation, Chapter 4 is a remarkable retcon in the sense that John Wick could have ended the hunt for his person way earlier, thus making at least the last two installments redundant.There's plenty of action here, sure, but it has been getting more and more unrealistic, and so you'll be in a situation where your suspension of disbelief says bye-bye, especially when you contrast the growing ridiculousness of the action with John Wick's decreasing vigour.The plot has some toddler level plot holes and contrivances which are really distracting, yes, even in an action no-brainer like this. Keanu Reeves has maybe ten lines of dialogue in the whole movie. The Marquis is a nonsense character, just like Donnie Yen's Caine character. They just appear, but especially in Caine's case you're supposed to be emotional about it because he's basically John Wick's brother from another mother. We just never knew about him. Oh well.This is the definition of a dumb movie for dumb people, and if you just want to enjoy some nice shots and over-the-top action (some of which is really nice) AND love Keanu Reeves, this is your jam. If you need a bare minimum of consistency and structure, you might feel cheated.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this. Updating rating from 8 to 9 stars.(4 viewings, opening Thursday UltraScreen 3/23/2023, UltraScreen 3/28/2023, SuperScreen 4/10/2023, re-issue IMAX 5/2/2023)\",\n",

It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.\",\n",

Answer, not possible, only in this movie and series. How many times could the dog man have killed Wick? Many. So no other assassin could? Why would the table head get Caine to kill Wick when he knows he won't. You can challenge the head to a duel as a rule, but they only assigned a head for the first time ever in this movie? WTF? And then the head can select a replacement? And he selects a blind man. All Wick had to do was to stand on the side or drop down and he wouldn't get shot. I think everyone knew Wick didn't shoot in the last round, except for the stupid head bad guy. This is not an action movie, it's a fantasy.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.Covering four continents, we get fights on a massive set of stairs, fights in the middle of traffic, at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen, and so on. The fighting, of course, is exceptional, and it brings nunchakus, dogs, throwing stars, swords, guns, and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and, because these films are so technically proficient, you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene, one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature, but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.Admittedly, the story does leave a bit to be desired, but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get. Hollywood has a new film to hold itself to and I have a feeling that (at least for me) action filmmaking will be judged by the standard this movie sets. It's such a blast, I already want to see it again.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.\",\n",

Seems after coming up with the bullet proof suit the writers etc thought it a good idea to make sure everyone has one. These giant men sent to kill Wick all wearing suits, raising the jacket to protect their heads was a sight I found so funny. He's the best hitman on the world, how do we kill him? I know, we'll send a blind man!! Pathetic. And he can dodge bullets and he knows where everyone is. You could say it looked choreographed.Now, about the DJ!

The screenplay was so pretentious and pointless, the dialog looked forced and boring, katana swords vs. Bullets, and almost every bullet could be fenced off by the katana sword blades. The scenarios and the plots just kept stacked up without any reason or clue, just kill, kill, kill...nothing but kills. All the fighting sequences just like Shaw Brothers' 1970s poor and laughable Hong Kong martial art movies, heavily choreographically staged, looked so forced and fake. Every kill was not killed with one bullets but many, yet the handguns seemed equipped with endless bullets, bang, bang, bang, even the fallen guys already dead, but still needed to be shot several times more to increase the violent sound effect. I don't know what's the purpose of making these 4th Chapter, and I think the 1st Chapter only needed a following 2nd Chapter to end it, but what the heck, brainless young viewers need bloody fights, more dead bodies, ridiculous screenplay with clueless storyline, no real plots or real story really needed, just created something like violent video games.When John Wick fought for his life in the Japanese hotel against so many clueless foes and the Zatoishi-like blind swordsman played by Donny Yen with a Botox injected face, we all decided to quit at the same time.Hey, it's time to wrap it up, guys, no sense to continue to Chapter 5!\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.The film opens in New York City, the home of the notorious Continental Hotel, and takes us to Osaka Japan, Paris France, and Berlin Germany. Each of those cities plays a major role in Reeves' quest to seek revenge against the High Table for the acts outlined in the prior films, and to seek his unconditional freedom from service to their order.As the story unfolds we learn a bit more about Wick's past and upbringing than we did in the prior films, but not enough to get bogged down in. He uses his connections to his past, and the help of some old friends to find a path to level the playing field with the High Table's Emissary, The Marquis, played masterfully by Bill Skarsgård. Skarsgård makes the character memorable, and unique, with just a hint of Santino from the second installment.Keanu Reeves as John Wick in John Wick 4. Photo Credit: Murray Close\\nHiroyuki Sanada and Reeves are reunited, having starred in 47 Ronin together. Sanada, as is always the case, is a strong presence in the film and makes the most of every scene he is in. He is a great addition to the film. The Osaka Continental fight scenes are groundbreaking, and among the best and most exciting in the entire series. This is some of the best fight and action choreography you will see; only topped by other scenes in this same movie.Scott Adkins plays an unusually larger than life villain adeptly. The action and violence around the Berlin scenes involving his character, and his relationship to Reeves' past is fun to watch. Adkins is great to watch, whether starring in his own projects, or supporting, as he is here.Shamier Anderson and Clancy Brown are new to the series and add great value. Anderson as a cunning assassin conflicted between admiration and greed. Clancy Brown is a strong presence and welcome replacement in the role of Adjudicator. I found Asia Kate Dillon's version of the same character to be the weakest part of the prior film, and, perhaps, of the whole series.Mark Zaror, another great martial artist also has a prominent role as The Marquis' right hand man.Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne return and offer more than just familiarity to the cast. Their roles are significant and meaningful.Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.Keanu Reeves continues to be engaging, empathetic, and dynamic in the role of John Wick. While the series has strayed a bit from the deeply reluctant anti-hero of the first film; we continue to cheer for the good guy caught up in a bad, bad world. One of the great strengths of the film is that Reeves and Stahelski are not afraid the let characters other than Wick shine. In fact, all of the stars of this one have their deeply profound and memorable moments in and out of the company of the main character. This really works.As for the fight and action choreography. The stunt team at 87eleven continue to elevate the game. The film has three major, larger than life action sequences, that each, individually, outdo anything you will see in any other non John Wick movie. As mentioned previously, the Osaka and Berlin scenes were high energy, high body count affairs. They were complete with gun fights, sword mastery, gun play, and one of the best nunchuck displays you will ever see outside of a Bruce Lee movie. As for the scenes in Paris, at the Arc De Tripomphe, and on the Church steps, they are unlikely to be forgotten and, unlikely, to be topped for years to come, if ever. They are unique and exciting and violent feasts for the eyes.While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree, Nothing can top the original, in my opinion; however, Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga? Remember, I said this was a Spoiler free review....John Wick: Chapter 4 earns a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is worth seeing, and probably seeing again. I predict a significant box office gross for this one, and it is well deserved.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Ok, so I got back from seeing this entry yesterday night. I\\'m writing this review in the early hours after midnight as the film went on for a good whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes!! But we\\'ll get to that in a bit...! Anyway, I was looking forward to this film since John Wick 3\\'s release back in 2019 & this film has had a bit of a troubled history of getting pushed back until it finally got its March 2023 release. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but, was looking forward to this as the John Wick films are ace, but this film was a bitter disappointment...!The film sees John Wick, who from the events of the last film, has a price on his head which is increasing more than ever. The lethal unstoppable force of nature assassin now must fight against the High Table Global as he seeks out & fights the most deadly assassins players of the underworld from Paris to New York to Berlin to Japan. Will John Wick finally meet his match!?Whoa...! Where do I start!? I found the film for starters to be too long!! At a whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes this film is way, way, way too long! The pacing... whoa! Don\\'t get me started! I was willing to be tolerant & forgive the pacing, but when it got to the final leg it took the absolute puss & started to test my nerves! The story is so weak I had to look this film up in order to get what the plot was, again, another sign that the film was going to be bad, the first was the runtime, which I knew was going to be bad from the word go!The film took a while to get going which was a pain, but it got there I guess! The fights were good, as with the John Wick films typically are, not to mention funny & brutal! But all things considered, it got repetitive fast & annoying especially near the end as I just mentioned! The story scenes were alright as with the villains & bad guys though again, it got repetitive & irritating.The realism was stretch beyond its limits here in this film. John Wick fell from a great height on a metal pipe which looked to have (& lets be honest here) would\\'ve snapped his back like a tooth pick! John got hit by a car 5 times yet never suffers any bad injuries or dies! Yet a few bullet wounds finally kill him at the end (another downer of this film which I\\'ll touch up on in a second!), the fight scenes in the night club where only a few people stood there shocked while about 95% just kept on dancing! Face palm! There were several other scenes which made you just think \"dafuq!?\"The lead up to the end was annoying! Just when you thought John Wick was going to go to the Stand Off with the blind villain, there was more fight scenes! Don\\'t get me wrong, these fights where good, but annoying & held the film up for a good 20 minutes before the finale which to say the least, was anti climatic! The scene on the 122 steps was irritating & made you just scoffs in frustration when John got kicked down those steps which for a couple of seconds in its self, dragged & felt & looked comical! It\\'s like getting so far in a mission in Grand Theft Auto V then dying & reverting back to the latest checkpoint where you have to start all, over, again!! The same feelings of that (from experience) where felt for me in this film from that scene!Then of course, after John Wick killing 180 odd people (or more, I lost count obviously) he finally dies! What!? Like James Bond in that god awful Bond Film of 2021 No Time To Die!? Can\\'t be!? What a poor show! Anyhow, to give you guys some perspective on how long this is in comparison to the rest of the films in the franchise! Without credits as they don\\'t count!John Wick (2015) - 1 hour 30 minutes\\nJohn Wick 2 (2017) - 1 hour 50 minutes\\nJohn Wick 3 (2019) - 1 hours 57 minutes\\nJohn Wick 4 (2023) - 2 hours 39 minutesNotice how the films got long & long with each entry...!Overall, this ranks as they absolute worst of the franchise! I was willing to forgive the poor pacing & overly bloated runtime, but it got on my nerves too much to bare & when I saw that John Wick died!? Nope, that was it for me! The editing was poor with this film whoever edited this needs class in editing as this was bad beyond belief! The pacing also was poor combined with the bad editing! The fights were good, but too drawn out, long & annoyingly repetitive! The ending was both bad & anti climatic! How this film has 95% on RT is beyond me! But then what do I expect...! This ranks as the worst John Wick film in the franchise! With word of a female spin-off coming out (which will be bad), I\\'ve lost hope in this franchise! Let\\'s hope John Wick 5 (if ever) redeems this kak entry!4/10 & that\\'s generous considering!',\n",

       "  'comment': \"In a world where movie sequels seem to be loathed even before they are released, the 'John Wick' series has remained remarkably consistent and well received. In fact all three of the first films have the same IMDb rating of 7.4/10 and I noticed recently that I gave them all the same rating of 8/10. Incredibly, I think 'John Wick: Chapter 4' is the best the series has to offer. This movie was a wild ride.I was a little disappointed when I first saw the runtime for this one was going to be almost 3 hours. I find that is becoming a tough runtime for a lot of films to justify. This film does it with no trouble. The pacing is so incredibly fast that the 3 hours pass by in no time. I remember looking down at my watch early in the film thinking maybe 20-25 minutes had gone by and almost an hour had already passed.A large reason for this is the action sequences. When an action sequence starts in this film buckle in, because it is going to go for nearly 20-30 minutes and be non-stop craziness the for the duration.The action sequences in this film are perfectly shot as they always are in this series. Lovely, wide camera angles so we can see every thing that happens and know that it isn't all being edited to look this way. These people are actually doing these things.As always with these films you need to go in a rather incredible suspension of belief. Wick is nearing super-human level at this point. It doesn't matter how many cars you hit him with or how high the building he falls off is, he'll be back and fighting again 10 seconds later. It's best to switch your brain off at these points I have found.Finally, I loved the main villain in this movie played excellently by Bill Skarsgård. He was everything a villain should be. Calm and seemingly in control, menacing and easy for the audience to hate and root against.This film was a blast from start to finish. 9/10.\",\n",

Chad Staleski created such a great action extravaganza quad of films and one of my favorite trivia's he was the stunt doable for Keanu Reeves in the The Matrix back in the day; fast forward to 2014 they work together on one of the greatest action films of our generation. John Wick 4 is ultimate experience that is a must see I can't praise enough for how much fun it is.I might get vibes for my thoughts I tried not to spoil it's obvious the combination of kill count has added up the rest left to the viewers, the action and writing is incredible for Chapter 4 that everyone involved deserves praise! I'd like to say too I own all the John Wick films and every Matrix, I'll get this in 4K when available.\",\n",

This is why john wick is the best action action movie franchise of all time; The movies just keep getting better and better. In john wick 4, when the action starts in Osaka Japan, it never let\\'s up despite it\\'s almost 3 hour running time. What I really enjoyed the most about JW4 is the cast of characters. Great villains and allies really keep this movie interesting as john trots the globe for 3 hours. The sound engineering, editing, direction, cinematography are excellent as always. The color schemes throughout this franchise (more john wick 2, 3 and especially 4) are such a treat for the eyeballs. Best action franchise EVER. And the shotgun fight in Paris with the \"dragons breath\" is the best action sequence I\\'ve probably ever seen in my life.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Listen, this movie was far from as good as the others and had very little realism to it compared to the others. Numerous times John falls from like 4 stories up and gets up and walks it off. He also gets hit by cars numerous times and simply just walks it off. He also falls down 222 steps and gets up and walks it off. Where is the realism here?Also, the acting was incredibly bad. Like really really bad. Laurence Fishborne going over the top and Keanu not saying much, but when he does he makes himself sound like he's having a stroke.Adding the black assassin dude simply as the diversity hire was a weird choice. Like seriously, he was the only black dude. The dude was a complete wild card that you had no idea whose side he was on. He was trying to kill John, but also trying to save him? Also, he had a dog to help him. Didn't Halle Berry have the exact same gimmick in the last movie that did the same trick of going for the nuts?And where was John's motivation for all of this? Why was he in Japan? Why did he kill the High Table person? Why wasn't this Marques person introduced sooner? Why was a blind assassin 20x better than any of the other assassins? And lastly, why did John go through allllll of that crap just to die at the end? To protect Winston? The dude who shot him off roof?Overall, there was only a couple of good parts to the movie. Nothing that the other 3 movies hadn't done before.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Elemental has several obvious glaring problems. For one thing, the attempt to make the elements' differences an overt metaphor for race/culture is shallow and misplaced at best most of the time.The story's themes and plot itself are about as worn-out and tired as the art of the story itself. Not a single new idea is really explored at this level.And, at the more surface level, the film's visuals vary greatly in quality: the environments are gorgeous, colorful, and vibrant, while the character designs appear haphazard, thrown together, and honestly kind of ugly.But where this film shines-and I mean REALLY shines, surprisingly-is in the writing of its characters.Ember and Wade are instantly distinct, understood, and likeable. They both grow tremendously and at a consistent pace. They are 110% the reason to see this film. I got emotionally wrapped up in their lives and desires in a way that I've only felt in Pixar's best films. This is the sole great achievement of Elemental.The one other thing I can praise is the sound design and the musical score-both of which are largely powerful and memorable.Maybe it's that my expectations were on the floor going into this, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. Maybe wait to catch it on streaming, but don't write it off completely.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'In a world where beings of fire, water, air, and earth exist, Ember Lumen (Leah Lewis) is a first generation fire elemental and daughter of immigrants Bernie and Cinder (Ronnie del Carmen and Shila Ommi respectively) who emigrated to Element City facing prejudice and systemic segregation to start a bodega, called The Fireplace, that is the unofficial hub of Firetown which Bernie hopes Ember will someday inherit. Ember routinely struggles to keep her temper with customers and during one such episode inadvertently damages an old water pipe which pulls in city inspector Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie) from the other side of town and must reluctantly issue several citations on the bodega. After learning of Ember\\'s struggles with trying to takeover The Fireplace from her ailing father, Wade feeling guilty over it tries to help Ember save The Fireplace as well as find out why there is water still running through Firetown when it shouldn\\'t and eventually a romance blooms in spite of the historic incompatibility with fire and water.Elemental is the latest film from Pixar and comes to us from director Peter Sohn who based the initial idea off his immigrant parents and based the underlying concept around the relationship between fire and water. The film was primarily based off of the structure of romantic comedies and dramas such as Guess Who\\'s Coming to Dinner?, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and The Big Sick while also building those ideas around the core elemental one. In terms of execution Elemental does have some of the same issues of Sohn\\'s The Good Dinosaur, but it is a nice light romance with a solid presentation of its core themes.I\\'ll start off by saying the opening scenes where we establish Element City and the characters of Bernie and Cinder are really good as we see them rejected by several prospective renters as despite Element City\\'s history of welcoming immigrants as per the murals on the harbor, the fire elementals being the newest entrants to society are very much treated with hostility and prejudice. This sequence continues onward with the Lumen\\'s eventually buying a neglected building an refurbishing it as their bodega and overtime it becoming the central point of Firetown. The animation used to bring the elementals and their world to life is nicely done as there\\'s a lot of great details in the textures and movements of the characters with the distortions of water and the movement of fire and while on occasion the world building can seem a little spotty and doesn\\'t feel as fully realized as Zootopia\\'s, it does a good job of addressing systemic racism in communities. Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie are both really solid as Ember and Wade and their interactions with each other are complemented with some cute moments and amusing exchanges. I also rather liked the relationship with Ember and her father Bernie played by Ronnie del Carmen that while sweet does a good job of setting up the wedge issue.While I think Elemental has good pieces in place, I did feel like some parts of the film felt underdeveloped especially in regards to a leak in Firetown responsible for the water seeping in that doesn\\'t feel all that interesting and I felt like from a world building perspective it opened up some questions that the movie didn\\'t really address. While Elemental has no villain in it, this is the kind of plot point that feels like it could\\'ve used a villain be it an unscrupulous developer or a construction firm rigging bids to add that little extra \"something\" that\\'s missing from this plot point because it\\'s a pretty big one and its not all that fleshed out.I liked Elemental for the things that did genuinely work even if it stands in the shadows of others who\\'ve covered similar material. I think this is a much better project from Peter Sohn in comparison to The Good Dinosaur even if like that film there are still some flubs in the presentation of the central idea even if not to the extent The Good Dinosaur had them. But contrary to what people have said, this is not one of Pixar\\'s worst movies especially when you consider the Cars trilogy and Lightyear exist.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Elemental once again showcases the remarkable and dazzling visual touch, Pixar films are known for. As always, the studios meticulous attention to detail and praise worthy, imagination-driven animation stands front and center, in crafting a realistic world that audiences can get lost in. From the stellar personification of the elements, to the cleverly thought of and complementing Elemental City, the overall design is simply jaw dropping and convincing, consistent with the studios past offerings.Story-wise however, is where the film stagnates. Not to be mistaken, the immigrant centered, coming of age, breaking through barriers storyline does have its shining moments, but treads along the lines of overly familiar. The screenplay stumbles as well at times, producing blank faced reactions to some of its heavy handed scenes such as Embers family centered conflict. As for the romance, Pixar redeems itself, for fashioning an opposites attract love story, made charming by its fascinating character quirks and animation. Somehow, someway, this felt fresh.Overall, I found no surprise in critics underwhelmed responses to Elemental. It is however undeniable, that the film does enough, and if comparisons to Pixars early works can be avoided (a BIG if), deeper appreciation for Ember and Wades world is definitely in the horizon. It is 2023 and happily, Pixar has yet to produce a bad film.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Recently we went and watched Disney\\'s \"Elemental\", and we\\'ve got a bit to say about it!First off, we both loved this movie! The worst thing about this movie is how little we saw about it before hand. \"Elemental\" centers around Ember, a fire elemental immigrant to element city, with a bit of a temper and a ton of pressure to save and take over the family business, and Wade, a water elemental who just so happens to also be an extremely emotional city code inspector.Elemental does very well bringing to light the challenges an immigrant family/group faces in a new environment, while also making sure it\\'s wrapped up in a cute animated rom-com. The other elements are afraid, hostile, or dismissive when it comes to the the fire district and its people,but it\\'s evened out with the budding romance between your two main characters. It also does very well in showing how important unity is among different groups of people. The art and animation in this one are amazingly done as well! The characters, in our opinion, are all well animated, well designed, and unique enough in their own ways. The animation, as standard with Pixar, is 100% on point.Elemental, however, does lack in a select few areas. The side characters for the air and earth elements were all forgettable. Clod, Fern, Gale, and Lutz are all forgettable. The main characters and their families are well done and fleshed out. But they miss the mark on the backup characters. The story is also, nothing we\\'ve never seen before. Obviously it\\'s hard to continuously come up with brand new never done before stories, so this is only a small critique, but it\\'s been done before.Overall though, we loved Elemental. It\\'s a fantastic choice to watch with the family/kids. It didn\\'t feel like anything was forced, there\\'s good jokes for both parents and kids, it has an emotional ending, and the movie does do a good job of getting its message across. It\\'s a Pixar romantic comedy movie and it does what it set out to do. It won\\'t change the world, but it\\'s got a good message.We recommend this movie 100% if you\\'re a fan of family friendly animation, or Disney movies in general. IMDb has this at a 7.1 but collectively we give this an 8/10.TLDR - With a few lows, we still loved elemental and feel it\\'s a great movie to watch with the family on movie night! Catch it when it comes to streaming! 8/10.',\n",

Don't get me wrong, the sweet elements were there especially from the God Father story in the beginning but then it becomes a classic cookie cutter Rom-Com movie with nothing new. Even my eight year old got bored from the first half. The story does improves by the second half but again, I feel PIXAR has lost its magic. I feel that PIXAR is more now about quantity versus quality story telling. The movie had too much visual but lacked to hit home with the story. By the end, my daughter and I were glad the movie was over.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"What can I say about Elemental that will do it justice? It never really takes off. It's a familiar tale with a new setting and two dimensional characters.Pros- visually this puppy is stunning, the world is inspiring but familiar. The sound design is well done.Cons- the voice acting is very all over the place, some ok performances, but many just don't fit. The pacing is not very good either. The characters are too one note or two note.Overall this is kind of a bland movie going experience. It's an immigration tale of foreigners making it in a new city and dealing with the prejudices of being different, very Zootopia, but unlike that very charming tale, this movie just drags and the characters are very bland. The fire dad might be the most intriguing character but by far the biggest offender is Wade Ripple, the water boy, the just shove him on you and try very hard to make you like him and the chemistry between Ember and him is so contrived. Also there is no really good side characters for them to play off of. Kind of a waste in my opinion.It's a film that's pretty forgettable in the end. 4/10.\",\n",

Not much was stuff hadn't seen before. One of the things that did stick out to me was the animation. Nothing mind boggling but it is one of recent Pixar's best work visual wise. I loved how vivid everything was and the elements driving movements. This movie also made laugh multiple times, which for me is pretty good. Some of those laughs however might have just been cope with the cringe, which this movie has a lot of. Some of the movements that characters make in this movie made my face sickle up. This movie entertained me for a bit, just barely though. You could watch better things in your time but if you really want then this movie would be enough to fill a boring night.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'To start things off, Elemental is a heartfelt movie that parallels the trials and tribulations of pursuing one\\'s passion. While it\\'s no easy feat to transition to a place that\\'s completely different from your original hometown with all of its traditions and beliefs, moving into a new city that is much more diverse and expressive can become more of an opportunity if you know the right people. The one thing that remains are moral values. Director Peter Sohn sure made a movie that was greatly inspired from his parents moving all the way to America from Korea before he was even born. Although Sohn was born and raised in the states, it was his parents who showed him to also not lose sight of his heritage and family traditions.Now the plot tells the story of the Lumens, a husband and wife who traveled from the fire lands to start a new life in the multi-diverse, Element City. Which is entirely inhabited by the four basic elements that are earth, air, fire, and water. The Lumens set up shop in one district and eventually give birth to a daughter named Ember, who dreams of one day running her family\\'s business. However, upon meeting a water-based resident named Wade, Ember\\'s views greatly shift into something she might be truly missing in her life.Compared to past Pixar films, I think Elemental is uniquely different for the studio that combines thematic material, romantic elements, and prejudicial themes woven into one. Newcomers Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie as the lead roles Ember and Wade respectively did a splendid job when their characters are thrown into conflict over what really matters. I commend them for giving such believable performances and that they have this chemistry that is a science physically and emotionally. While the character designs and quirks are reminiscent to the emotions of Inside Out, it\\'s the setting and discriminatory nature of these characters that mirror Zootopia.Peter Sohn took it a step forward with this movie compared to his directorial debut called The Good Dinosaur. Unlike that movie, where it went with the theory of dinosaurs having not gone extinct and evolved more than humans, I loved the personal touches he gave in Elemental that reflect his own upbringing and meeting someone to love in the process. Quite frankly, I don\\'t really care what others say about this movie being \"by the numbers\" or \"not being at high standards\" as older Pixar classics or any recent animated hits of theirs. Kids will love it for the humor and whimsical nature of these elemental characters, while adults would find the intense situations relatable to them in terms of acceptance and being true to themselves. I enjoyed it for the experience that can be very real in anyone\\'s lives. Pixar still got it.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Elemental is bad, it's as simple as that. There were a few key issues that are easy to pinpoint, but overall the reason this failed is much more abstract. I think the main issue is that Pixar got in way over their heads. They had this story idea but no real means to animate it, so once they figured out a way to animate it (using 151,000 computer cores), they then had to work around the confines of this massive animation project. And by all means, you can tell this was an issue; cutaways and transitions are awful throughout, and you can tell that the script is majorly rushed to get past this factor; It seemed lazy. Not one character takes a breath in this film before moving on to the next rushed, poorly-written line. Scene after scene with no real meaning and every story element (pun intended) that was supposed to elicit some type of emotional response was given to you in an unsolicited flashback that made no sense. And this created some cringeworthy backstory scenes and dialogue that came out of nowhere. It was quite possibly one of the worst films I have seen in a long time, and it's more heartbreaking that it came from Pixar.Now to be fair to what they've done here, the animation is beautiful, they created a really good-looking animated film, but there was no time to appreciate it due to quick cuts and pointless filler scenes. Once again, Disney and Pixar prioritized the wrong things, taking away from this beautiful feat of animation to create a sloppy pointless story.The voice acting was also sub-par, to say the least. Most of it was average and doesn't make you think twice, except for Ember (Leah Lewis), who really shined, seeming to give real emotion in her lines despite the awful writing. But Wade (Mamoudou Athie) is a different story. His voice was heartless, in my opinion. And again, this may be the script's fault more than the voice acting since Wade was such a boring character who wasn't given a name until halfway through the film (which is insane to think about). We were given a few glimpses of Wade's emotional backstory that could have potentially had some importance to the story, but then the credits roll, and you feel the same way about him at the end as you did in the beginning. He was annoying, and his arc was flatter than the voice acting given for him.I didn't go into this film thinking it was going to be good, but I thought it could be fun. I was proven wrong in a big way. Overall the only redeeming part is its animation which is overshadowed by its story issues. It's worth a watch for the animation alone, but should not be glorified for any other aspect of it (which seems to be what many are doing.\",\n",

Whether it\\'s a water-being\\'s sneeze causing grass to sprout or Ember\\'s intense heat affecting others around her, these moments showcase the intricate relationships between the elemental residents.

The character development is strong, and you can\\'t help but cheer for Ember and Wade as they face their challenges and strive to make a positive impact on their community.With its breathtaking visuals, compelling storyline, and heartfelt message, \"Elemental\" is a true cinematic gem.

       "  'comment': 'Pixar\\'s recent movies have struggled to capture audiences, with previous non-sequels like \"Soul,\" \"Luca,\" and \"Turning Red\" resembling yesteryear, but launching directly to Disney+. The last real hit was 2019\\'s \"Toy Story 4.\" Fans will appreciate the \"Carl\\'s Date\" short, \"Elemental,\" which combines fire and water, creating a successful film, and is Pixar\\'s and Disney\\'s best film since zootopia. \"Elemental\" is a rom-com with nonstop puns and on-the-nose aspects, but it still has a winning sweetness. The film\\'s chemistry between Ember and Wade is corny, but it still works well, despite the corny moments. The film\\'s rom-com elements, such as hot air balloon rides and authentic fire food, add to its overall appeal. \"Elemental\" has the wondrous aesthetic imagination of modern Pixar classics like \"Finding Nemo\" and \"Wall-E.\" However, composer Thomas Newman\\'s score offers a more comprehensive vision of cross-cultural exchange than the film\\'s muddled depiction of immigrant communities. While combustible from the moment, it makes a from memory after leaving the theater. Lewis portrays Ember with a playful warmth, complementing Athie\\'s bubbling affability in Wade. The element element in \"Elemental\" is overly complicated and confusing, focusing on nothing children know about the natural world. The film\\'s brisk pace and extensive exposition make it difficult to fit essential backstory into the final reel. Sohn should have made the plot simpler and focused on sincerity, as Pixar\\'s sincerity is essential. The over-complicated premise creates confusing rules for children to learn, which do apply outside the film. The animation of Ember\\'s body and Wade\\'s fluid, transparent body is exciting, emphasizing malleability and abstraction. However, the film\\'s promise of color, form, and movement is hemmed in by unimaginative storytelling. Only standout sequences, such as an underwater garden and hand-drawn animation, separate \"Elemental\" from other Pixar films. The characters are phosphorescent blobs traveling through realistically animated cityscapes, and the film never goes anywhere unexpected. The film follows Ember and Wade, two opposites who initially form a close bond but eventually separate due to a misunderstanding. However, their relationship becomes the film\\'s center, a respite from the mixed metaphors and conceptual mechanics that often threaten the story\\'s inner reality. The plot\\'s frantic chain reaction keeps them together, providing a slight but endearing center. The film explores the mystery of what will happen if Ember and Wade touch a mysterious mystery in a city with ceramic and terracotta glass structures.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'People are starved for originality lately, so why aren\\'t more movie-goers flocking toward the seemingly super-imaginative Elemental, the new entry in Pixar\\'s \"what if X had feelings\" saga? Why do people say they want originality but won\\'t give it any attention? Hmm? What gives? Well, the issue is that the premise of Elemental might not be all that inspired. It reads as if Pixar just sort of went \"Okay, so which objects/concepts can we personify next?\" -- or \"How can we make another allegory for racism without having to teach kiddies about actual racism?\" -- and then threw the darts.You get the sense that Disney-Pixar wanted a \"next Inside Out\" or \"next Zootopia\", not that someone had a brilliant idea for a story and images that simply had to get made. There is some creativity here and I adore some voices, but the world it creates is one that raises nagging questions, both in terms of in-universe logistics (What exactly does clothing and food mean to personifications of natural elements?) and how it is supposed to be reflecting the dynamics going on in our society. If the film is anti-prejudice, why use two characters whose very nature is such that they harm each other by merely being near each other?When I reviewed Across the Spider-Verse, I spoke of how its success proves that \"people crave something with more energy, artistry, and detail than what Disney has to offer\". At that moment, I was talking about ATSV vs Marvel, but it rings true in terms of animated cinema as well (note that no Pixar or Disney release lately has compared to the reception of either ATSV or Dreamworks\\' Puss in Boots: The Last Wish).It also rings true in terms of Disney vs other films that tackle similar social themes. Someone on TikTok pointed out that there\\'s just no reason to see Elemental when we already have superior, more straightforward immigrant stories in Everything Everywhere All At Once (another movie whose success is a sign of better, less Disney-heavy times) and the upcoming Past Lives.Of course, another problem for Elemental is that it got released in June, alongside too many other films to choose from (of which only a few seem to make a splash, no pun intended -- this film has enough of those). It looks very pretty, of course, but that\\'s not enough of a draw to get people to the multiplex -- as opposed to waiting for it to land on Disney+ (where it may yet find a fandom in the \"I\\'m 14 and this is deep\" crowd, for whom movie tickets aren\\'t as financially feasible as using the family Disney account).',\n",

The magic of Elemental lays in the fictitious world it has created for itself.

       "  'comment': 'Shakespeare needn\\'t worry that Pixar\\'s Elemental will replace Romeo and Juliet as the #1 love story of all time. However, this colorful animation has a right to be considered one of its kind in its thematic emphasis on opposites attracting and our seeking our own way rather than fulfilling someone else\\'s dreams. Perhaps more of a dominant theme is the immigrant experience that shows the challenges of assimilation. Director Peter Sohn speaks of his Korean parents\\' experience as the inspiration.The linchpin of this typical Pixar piece is a world where the elements of earth, air, fire, and water peacefully co-exist if, for instance, the last two don\\'t mix. When water denizen Wade Ripple (voice of Mamoudou Athie) falls for fire Ember (Leah Lewis), and she eventually succumbs, the incompatible worlds collide. The multiple metaphors and ingenious twists for each element, e.g., fire family business is called \"the Firehouse,\" are a tribute to the imagination of Sohn and his creative crew.The subtheme of parents\\' expectations is almost as strong as the love theme. Ember\\'s dad expects her to take over his shop while she is reluctant to say she doesn\\'t want to. Her budding romance almost busts because of this conflict. Elements does a credible job of showing how difficult it is for loving children not to fulfill the dreams of doting parents. What is not lost is the need for us to govern our own futures and not cave to the demands of others.Unlike other current movie dramas, especially animations like Spider-Man, Elements moves in a linear war with a plot that makes sense, even if it is predictable. Smaller children at my screening were restless, leading me to question if they should be 10 and beyond to appreciate the several themes; less than ten for a while will be distracted by the intricate city and explosive color.In the end it is still Pixar, a gifted Disney enterprise that never forgets it\\'s all about the people.',\n",

What gets me more concerned is the portrait of the fire people\\'s conservativeness and constrains applied to their offerings. What\\'s the point of rephrasing a real-life issue, not elevating or solving them but just apply a cartoon filter to it?The style and the city reminds me of Zootopia, which did a much better job in connecting the characters on a deeper level through mysterious events. Unlike Zootopia, their is no underlying message or lesson learned, or mystery solved, or any reflection that resonate with the audience.Not recommended.

I think my favourite thing was the subtle themes of diversity and inclusivity throughout as well as the very relevant storyline of certain people being excluded from society simply for being different. It can work on many levels and I thought this movie would be an excellent way to introduce young children to these issues similar to how Inside Out was utilised. The main characters were sweet and the voice actors did a good job to give them vivid personalities. The animators did an excellent job as some scenes were just STUNNING and I loved how the fire characters weren't just orange but actually moved like a flame even when standign still. That must've been hard to annimate but they did any amazing job. To summarise: Visually stunning sweet story about the struggle of cast-out members of society.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Granted, this film is not going to appeal to people who have never been fans of any games featuring the titular brothers. But given the fact that these filmmakers were tasked with making a movie that caters to a fan base that spans four decades and thus have a myriad of tastes and expectations, they did a pretty good job. In fact, a slightly better job than I was expecting.The voice cast was the subject of much controversy, and I thought that for the most part it was actually spot-on. A couple of characters were horribly miscast in my opinion, but in particular Jack Black as Bowser and Charlie Day as Luigi shine as perfectly encapsulating the spirit of the characters.Platforming elements from the games was very efficiently worked into the action sequences, and some of them were quite thrilling. This is easily Illumination's most visually stunning film, and a massive step up from every one of their other films since the first Despicable Me.As for the plot, it's just the plot of every Mario game. And for the most part, that's all it needs to be. Every beat plays out almost exactly like you'd expect it to, with a couple subversions pleasantly thrown in there.The messiest parts of the movie, if I'm going to get critical, are the dialogue (which is often quite stupid) and the characters. They just try to deal with too many of them, and although four or five characters are strongly introduced with background and desires, almost none of these introductions actually amount to a payoff, and even when there is a payoff, it's haphazardly thrown together for a rushed ending.Although I think 85-90 minutes is actually the perfect length for an animated film normally, this one could've benefitted from an extra 10-20 minutes to flesh out these points a bit more. We move so quickly from location to location that there's never any time to breathe or get invested.But that's my adult perspective. I had a pretty breezy, fun, and heartwarming time, though I would've liked more meat on the script.My theater was PACKED, and probably 75% young children, and they all seemed to have the time of their lives. Your kids will probably love it, and you will probably more than tolerate it.\",\n",

I still think an adult who isnt a fan could still enjoy it but this movie is so full of fan service that it will have you smiling the whole time. The voice acting I was skeptical but they all work and work well too. Jack Black is the star here. I love how they kept the story simple like all of the games. Truly felt like a video game on screen. This movie felt like a beautifully animated amusement park ride. The audio in the movie was amazing too. The sounds and the score with reimagined iconic music was perfect. Some of the songs in the movie felt unnecessary but they worked. I think they should've bumped the run time to 105-120 min. 90 min felt too short as it goes by quick. I havent had this much wholesome fun at the movies in a long time. If youre a fan you HAVE to see it.\",\n",

The visuals are stunning, and while everyone has their reservations about Chris Pratt the voice acting is perfect (except one for one elderly character).

A lot of the jokes are basic sure, but it's just impressive that there is some competency to a Video Game Movie. Sometimes simple and straightforward is the best way to go. Not high art or anything, but it ticks off almost everything for what Mario should be at least. Voice acting wasn't as bad as I thought, and Jack Black was the highlight as expected. Yeah, not gonna win any big awards but judge it for what it is, and yeah by Video Game Movie standards it's one of the best ones easily if you ask me.6.5/10.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"This is a movie that feels like a love letter to all the Nintendo fans out there, even if they don't necessarily play Mario anymore. The film delivers a fun and enjoyable experience for viewers by faithfully adapting every aspect of the game into the movie, including the Mario Kart and Donkey Kong franchises. The movie is packed with non-stop action and fast-paced storytelling, leaving little room for some of the more significant elements that fans might have wanted to see. It may not be able to fulfill every fan's wishes, but it's understandable and sets up for a sequel, as there is a post-credits scene.But for general audiences who are not familiar with Mario enough, this might be a movie that is difficult to understand. There may be questions like why does it have to be like this? Why do it this way? Why is the world so strange? This is because the story hardly explains in detail for us to know how the world is. Even though the story is simple and has nothing much. But if you don't think too much, it's an easy and enjoyable movie to watch, with the lovable characters in the style of the works from the studio that made Despicable Me.\",\n",

I remember playing Mario kart double dash on GameCube 20 years ago with my sister during Christmas Day and I absolutely loved the game . Universal and Nintendo did a great job making this movie for kids and adults who played the video game since the 80s 90s 2000s to now . The Mario movie was absolutely awesome and very creative from the video game . Chris was absolutely hilarious as Mario . Jack black as bowser was the best for the film. His voice was a mixture of Vader which I find so outstanding. Chris who voiced Mario did a fantastic job. He used the characters voice very carefully. The sounds were just like the video game. And i think that was absolutely awesome. The story taking place in New York to the mushroom kingdom is brilliant. Princess peach was the best part of the movie . She had a good way of showing bowser she will not marry a turtle . And toad was the best part of the movie . The rest of the characters including donkey Kong voiced by Seth rogen was so awesome. I hope in the next Mario movie yoshi finds Mario and Luigi and becomes they're pet.\",\n",

Mario Bros. Doesn't have any inherent plot holes or issues, but it tends to leave you in a state of just being a viewer rather than participating in the movie. In the end, it's not bad per se, but comes off as flat and lifeless.The positives are all agreed upon by anyone who likes it, because the positives stand out by not being able to be compared against anything else. People have fun with the action. They love the Easter eggs. And the composed music is good. The action is done well, but without much dramatic weight, only carry the movie so far. Easter eggs don't nor should have any bearing on how good the ovoid is. The music was well incorporated, minus the pop songs that truly don't work.It's not good enough to play things easy, and rely on fans to spot visual Easter eggs, to call the movie good. It's average at best mostly because it was watchable and didn't have any outright flaws. It just didn't take chances that could've ended up becoming flaws. Even if you had a good time watching it, there's not enough value to see it again. If you're a fan, check it out. If not, you won't miss a thing by skipping it.\",\n",

Jack black did an amazing job with voice acting bowser. Everyone did a great job and while I do agree Chris Pratt could have been better i got use to it really quick and im sure pretty much everyone else will too and besides, the Italian accent in the games is great but definitely not meant for a 80 minute movie. The plot is very simple which is good however because a Mario story shouldn't be complex at all and the people at illumination definitely know how the games should be. Speaking of that, you can tell the people behind this movie put a lot of heart into it.

The animation is strong, the worlds are exactly like the video games and truly fun moments for kids. The runtime is great and the movie moves along without pause.AND I expect better, higher quality movie making.The voice acting in this movie is so lazy. Chris Pratt is forgettable-anyone could have done better voicing such a beloved character. Princess Peach is the same - voice acting is boring and fairly emotionless. The worst voice acting belongs to Seth's terrible Donkey Kong junior - not a single attempt to make an actual character voice, just Seth's normal voice slapped on Donkey Kong. Toad's voice acting is also meatless and without any real jokes.The script is mostly empty and there is little to no attempt at character motivation, organic character decision making - for example, why Princess Peach tells Mario he can come with her to save her kingdom. Almost every opportunity to make a joke is skipped. None of the characters have stated goals aside from King Koppa.And saddest of all to me, there is no attempt to create backstory or give context to these beloved worlds and characters.\",\n",

Movie rights the wrongs of the last one; though it's certainly not a perfect movie, it's perfectly fine for what it is, and as family entertainment goes I've seen far worse than it. And with the gorgeous animation, the faithfulness to the games and the music, Chris Pratt and co. Do their best with the same old 'Mario comes to save Peach' storyline being worn thin at this point.Sure the film's problems can be dissected to the nth degree on YouTube retrospectives talking about the movie, but it is what it is and it works where other blockbuster fan-service vehicles have failed (like Terminator: Dark Fate, Ghostbusters 2016 or The Lion King 2019). And Mario (at least Nintendo) has the potential to become a cinematic powerhouse that defies the 'bad' press and reviews (they're more mixed for the movie).The film is basically feature-length comfort food more than anything else; and considering it's a family film that's pretty harmless, I'd say it's done its job more than well. Certainly better than Illumination's other more recent films I'd say.The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the safest kind of cinema, and maybe some people should accept what they see; but not everyone has to. Besides, fun is fun. 3.5/5 stars.P. S. Could this film lead to other stuff like Zelda hitting the big screen? Or maybe even Metroid? Who knows?\",\n",

Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen.

The story is barely present, every scene leads into the next with very little plot or agency - things just happen, characters just need things, that place is suddenly a karting city, that other place has an elevator leading up to a castle straight up a cliffface. The script is probably just screams and the a few catchphrases. It's all held together by nostalgia baiting, references and pandering, wrapped in Minions slapstick. It is all barely coherent. There is also a thing to be said about the music which was murdering classic tunes, some of which is just shockingly bad.Is it a Mario movie? Sure. Is it a fun Mario product for the whole family? Yup. Is it a good movie? No, not really, in fact I'd give it a 6 if I am honest; not awful, but that's about it. So if you are 8 or a Mario fan - sure, you are likely to have a blast.

They even had unique aspects given to them that helped them stand out in all the right ways. The action was phenomenal with great depth and detail that shows how much work was put into this. There were so many nods and references to other classic Nintendo properties that you'd want to go back to find them all. And Charles Martinet is in this with a small but great role. But with all that said, it does mess up its flow with some of the music. Definitely not the original score though, since it mixes the classic music with an epic and emotional tone. But the copyrighted music Illumination probably payed a third of their budget for felt out of place in this film and took me out of the experience a couple times. Other than that, it's an amazing that I'll gladly watch again.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'As a Super Mario fan myself, I was hyping this movie up for quite a while. So was it worth that hype? Yes and no. The references, animation, voice acting, and world building are incredible. But, there\\'s a lot of filler and the plot isn\\'t that good either. Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the \"you just got Luigi\\'d\" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it\\'s mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that\\'s an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie. It\\'s not really based on the series, but besides that it\\'s incredible.',\n",

Waaaay better than that... garbage of a film.This new one explores all the common elements of the franchise, beautifully crafted world with attention to details. My 7 year old girl LOVED IT.

       "  'comment': 'This is gonna be one of my shorter reviews, since the movie isn\\'t bad, neither great.The voice acting was surprinsingly good. Keegan-Michael Key, Charlie Day, and Anna Taylor-Joy were my favourites. Chris Pratt as Mario worked pretty well, since this is a new take on the plumber.The visuals were good: colorful enviorements, beautiful effects and entertaining action.T\\nBut the main problem with the movie is it\\'s lenght. In 80 minutes, you don\\'t get that much out of it. It feels like they had a script for a 2 hour movie , but it was shortened to not bore the kids in the audience and to save some cash.The movie features a lot of locations, but it\\'s pretty lackluster in it\\'s world building since we barely spend any time in those. The dialogue is extremely limited and the scenes go by so fast, that many times, they become somewhat irrelevant to the plot. Since the characters got out of a sticky situation with so much ease, it fails to make you care about anything. How am I supposed to care for Mario since he defeats his enemies with so much ease. Same with Peach: she just gets into sticky situations, but a few seconds later she just gets out of it with the help of some deus ex machina crap.There\\'s no set up, no polished character arcs, there\\'s no pay-off, no forshadowing, almost anything.The characters are flat, boring, and lacking in personality. Their relationships don\\'t feel authentic, cause they barely spend any time together. The movie is so short that they spend like 30 minutes togehter (in the best case scenario, sometimes it can be less than 10 minutes) and at the end you\\'re expected to feel like they formed some great friendship, to feel that they have chemistry and things in common beyond: their humans, they want to defeat the same villain.Also it has a lot of Mario Stuff I guess....The reception for this movie was kinda pathetic. It was either pretentious critics, acting like this movie killed cinema or some trash, or a bunch of manchildren who need everyone to agree with them \"What did you expect from a Mario Movie?\". From the Mario Movie. You would expect... a movie: a story with conflicts that pay off. Likeable characters and immersive world-building. It\\'s a movie; of course I expect to me more complex than the Mario Games.I honestly didn\\'t k=connect with the movie. I was just waiting for it to end. I didn\\'t even intend to watch it until the internet decided that this is some ground breaking divisive movie. It\\'s not. Maybe it\\'s gonna leave a big impact on the industry, since in made over a billion dollars, but I highly doubt I\\'m gonna remember this movie once The Flash or the FNAF movie will come out, and people will move on to the next big shiny thing.With both terrible and good stuff, the movie is OK: a low-key waste of time, with mildly entertaining scenes and bright colors. I don\\'t see anyone outside of Mario Fans and Families getting that out of this.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'The headline basically tells the story. This is not a good movie. Anyone who claim this is a great fantastic movie probably have some issues. But this is neither as horrible as I see some people argue. This is just a middle-of-the-road sometimes funny decently entertaining movie with bad music and very lazy writing.The good is that this is decently fun, even funny a few times. And if you are a fan of the games, especially Mario Cart, you will smile through many scenes. The voice acting is great, and if you are a simple kid you are likely going to love this. Sadly there ends the good stuff.The bad starts with the story, or rather lack thereof. Because it is as simplistic as the games which is both a strength and a weakness, but mostly a weakness because this movie offers nothing. It is actually kinda soulless and cliche. The music is mostly atrocious. Just put on Mario Cart music on bad speakers and you basically have this movie. But what really bothers me though is that the lack of story and very simplistic writing which feels so lazy. No one really cared. They only wanted to make a fast paced Super Mario Movie with as many callbacks and in-house jokes as possible, and that is it. There is no deeper meaning, nothing new, no real character development, nothing worth noting. Also most of the fun stuff you already saw in the trailer, it is not much else. So lazily done.Sure you might have fun watching this, because it is not a bad movie, but will you remember this a few weeks from now? Will this be a classic? Do you want to see more? The answers to those questions is a big \"No\".In the end I give this a 5/10. If you have kids you think you might like this or you are high and want to get away from reality for a while, perhaps go see this. For the rest of you this will be a Meh at best.',\n",

The Critic score should not be taken seriously it\\'s nowhere near a bad nor average movie. There are some things that i didn\\'t like about it but overall i left the theaters with a smile.The Visuals are probably the best Illumination Studios has ever done, very smooth and gorgeous to look at. The human characters like Mario, Luigi and Peach\\'s faces look different from their videogame counterparts and kind of weird at first but you will get used to them and at least their clothing match but on the other hand the animals and creatures from the Mushroom Kingdom like the Koopas, Donkey Kong and Bowser all look very accurate and detailed.The Voice Acting, Sorry but Mario does NOT sound like Mario, at all in this movie! I\\'m not a fan of Chriss Pratt\\'s acting as Mario. Luigi sounds better but not accurate either, Peach is good i guess and Donkey Kong sounds like Seth Rogen...Yay... Bowser however, gets a straight 10/10 Jack Black actually tried to sound like Bowser and he should be cast again as Bowser in future movies. Long time Mario fans will be surprised to know that Charles Martinet is also in the movie, but not as Mario... The character he got to act for is such a waste and not even worth mentioning to be honest.The Story is not your typical Mario videogame story, it\\'s actually baffling at first how literal they took the Mario \"origin\" story of him being a New York plumber. The movie starts going in the wrong direction but as the movie goes on it becomes better and better and ultimately it worked in the end. The pacing is very fast there is no real character development except for Luigi and maybe Mario but there\\'s just too many relevant characters and not enough time to flesh them out. At least they all have defined personalities.Overall, it\\'s not an Amazing movie but definitely a fun and good first outing by Nintendo and Illumination, it\\'s full of Mario references and just good fan service like a Mario movie should be. Here\\'s hoping future Mario movies!!And 8 but giving it a 10 to even out the hater trolls.',\n",

Adam's performance, while expectedly goofy, can often be tiresome and overly exaggerated.Imagine the feeling when someone shares a particularly bad joke, and you find yourself laughing not because it's genuinely funny, but because of how poorly executed it is. That's the best way to describe this film. It may not be inherently funny, but there are occasional moments that elicited laughter due to the way they were presented. However, if approached from a different angle, the underlying concept of this film isn't entirely devoid of potential.I have mixed feelings regarding the time I invested in watching this film.

Unless you're a fan of Adam Devine and Blake Anderson and their infantile humor in Workaholics, you probably will cringe and eyeroll your way through the lame comedy, which is pretty much spot on with the Workaholics series. It feels like a bunch of failed SNL sketches. The entire writing is cliched and predictable, and the directing does nothing to elevate the already irritating comedy and generic story.

This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.\",\n",

       "  'comment': '\"Oppenheimer\" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (\"The Dark Knight trilogy\", \"Inception\", \"Interstellar\", \"Dunkirk\"), based on the biography \"American Prometheus\" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the \"Manhattan Project\", a top secret operation intended to develop the world\\'s first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project\\'s director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and \"Fat Man\" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the \"Atomic Age\". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as \"the father of the atomic bomb\", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan\\'s biopic \"Oppenheimer\", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man\\'s legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject\\'s life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer\\'s mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It\\'s hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan\\'s direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won\\'t speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film\\'s three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017\\'s \"Dunkirk\", which utilised the film\\'s score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can\\'t imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy\\'s acting and Nolan\\'s direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film\\'s cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon\\'s take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer\\'s talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves\\'s ignorance to Oppenheimer\\'s extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer\\'s achievements.It\\'s also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer\\'s ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss\\'s two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer\\'s life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, \"Oppenheimer\" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it\\'s a tough job, but someone\\'s got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.\",\n",

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.\",\n",

The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer!

       "  'comment': \"A solid film by Nolan but it is worth mentioning to some that if you're expecting action you will be tremendously disappointed. This is a biography of Oppenheimer that focuses on key moments of his life. What drove this movie for me was the top notch quality of acting and the sound/compositions which were instrumental in bringing out the drama within a lot of the dialogue and the acting chops throughout the movie. Please be warned that the overwhelming majority of this movie is dialogue.While both Interstellar and Inception were extremely deep films from Nolan(and in my opinion his best work), there was a popcorn quality about those films where you could loosen up and not take the experience too seriously and still find it entertaining. With Oppenheimer you better pay close attention to the dialogue and what's going on because you will be lost. With that being said it is rewarding getting a glimpse of the drama surrounding the development of nuclear weapons, some of the darkest times in human history. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer will be his defining role of a lifetime. The acting from the cast was flawless along with the brilliant sound editing. I expect this film will be force to be reckoned with at the Oscars.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'My Review - Oppenheimer\\nMy Rating Ten plus 10/10\\nIn Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it\\'s very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don\\'t appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds\", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it\\'s a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950\\'s when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he\\'s not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I\\'ve seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.',\n",

As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie.Movie critics will give this a good score owing to its incredible style and presentation and most of the audience will do the same. But purely from an entertainment point of view this was 7/10.\",\n",

I didn't feel a sense of urgency when the bomb was being made despite the race against Nazi Germany or a sense of accomplishment when it was finally detonated. He rushed around from set piece to set piece, trying to convey a sense of urgency without there being a sense of urgency written into the mechanics of the story itself. The detonation itself might as well have been created by CG since I couldn't tell the difference between a real bomb - from all the footage we have seen of the A bomb in archival footage and large scale bombs seen in Hollywood films since then. I didn't feel I got to know the man behind the myth, only the protracted battle for his reputation and the idea that he was martyred by the very people he helped furnish.\",\n",

It never stops, and it's very loud, a true assault of the senses. Second, its pacing is crazy-making slow. Even 20 minutes into it, I was thinking 'this has got to get better, right?' Only it never does. The dialog is difficult to hear (largely over the loud music that never stops), and the storyline is not easy to follow. But besides all this, it's just a shockingly boring movie. I'm a big movie fan, and this will go down as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.\",\n",

       "  'comment': '\"Oppenheimer\" or \"How the Father of the Atomic Bomb learned to start worrying and Hate the Bomb\"In this story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer it\\'s not just about his role in the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, but also the machiavellian manoeuvres going on to discredit him in the United States.The downfall of Oppenheimer is the main thrust of this story arc, long after he helped his government build the A Bombs that landed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing thousands of innocent civilians to end World War 2 even though Adolph Hitler was already dead and the Germans had surrendered.\"Oppenheimer\" is the most promising and prominent Oscar bait so far of 2023 for Best Picture, Screenplay, Sound Engineering, Actor, Supporting Actor etc.If this doesn\\'t sweep the floor then I don\\'t know what will.Cillian Murphy is outstanding, Robert Downey Jr. Unrecognisable at first and gives a very different performance.It\\'s almost like he\\'s channeling F. Murray Abraham (\"Amadeus\") and \"My Left Foot\" star Daniel Day Lewis.In fact, the way this film plays out reminded me of the genius of \"Amadeus\".This is one of the most impressive uses of an all-star cast I\\'ve ever seen.More often than not the higher the star count the lesser the movie, but director Christopher Nolan (\"Dark Knight\") manages to herd his cattle even better than Alfred Hitchcock.I\\'m talking about Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek & Aussie Jason Clarke to name a few.These actors transformed themselves for their roles superbly.The only actor noticeably absent from this ensemble was Michael Caine who\\'s been in many Nolan movies.Somehow no CGI was harmed in the making of this movie...none at all, despite the awesome Visual SFX.It\\'s not the first time Murphy & Nolan have worked, it\\'s their sixth collaboration, but it is Cillians first time as the lead in one of Christopher\\'s movies as the American theoretical physicist and Project Director of The Manhattan Project to create the first nuclear weapons of mass destruction.Plus I tips me hat to composer Ludwig Gorannson for his score, which takes this movie to another level.Special shout out also to cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema who worked with Nolan on \"Interstellar\", \"Dunkirk\" and \"Tenet\".\"Oppenheimer\" is based on the biographical book \"American Prometheus\" and when Nolan saw the cover art on the book he could only see Murphy in this titular role.Warning: Nudity & Sex scenes (in a movie about scientist nerds...I know right!)\\nAfter sitting through 3 intense hours of what could have been dry fodder in the hands of lesser people (it\\'s very wordy dialogue centric so please pay attention) I can understand why \"Oppenheimer\" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year.I saw this in The Lounge/Gold Class so I can\\'t begin to imagine how mind blowing \"Oppenheimer\" will look and sound in its intended IMAX format and for the first time ever Kodak invented Black and White IMAX film just for this movie.This is possibly the best, most important movie ever given the rumblings of war mongering in the world today.As J. Robert Oppenheimer states in this movie, \"I don\\'t know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can\\'t.\"\\nThis could possibly be Director Christopher Nolans Magnum Opus!',\n",

There is no true protagnoist and you spend the movie watching random characters appear on screen then die.2. The 'twist' does not help the movie but starts it down the frustrating path.3. Stupidity. All you need to to to survive is close your eyes, that simple. You could VERY EASILY open your eyes for a split second to see where you are going and close them again. Just because you open your eyes does not mean you have to keep them open, looking around, and do not react when the 'creature' is near. These are experienced survivors yet they are making first day mistakes for no reason at all outside of this being a bad movie.4. The acting is surprisingly good.5.

Somewhat the whole affair reminds me of a mediocre episode of The Walking Dead, one of those last few seasons. In short: Bird Box: Barcelona is no match for the original starring Sandra Bullock, which is a very suspenseful movie with some strong emotional scenes. But this one is simply one of those fast produced mass products that will be forgotten fast and fall (rightfully) into the void of all those trash movies produced for streaming services these days. A legit sequel to the original one? No. Just a cash grabber aiming at the Spanish speaking audience. Final verdict: solid produced boredom.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"For clarity, I liked the first Bird Box movie. Yes, it didn't give you closure. You never found out what the 'creatures' were. But, it had enough in it that gave a sense of tension and intrigue to draw you in and keep you with it. Bird Box '1' wasn't amazing, but it was ok.So, on to Bird Box Barcelona...Set wise, really good. Scores well on costume, FX, locations. But pretty much that's it.On the downside, the lead character is very unlikeable by nature of his choices in the first 2/3rds of the movie. As a result you can empathise with him or feel anything for him other than hoping he dies soon.The movie potters on and provides slightly more reveals demonstrating a link between whatever the creatures are, and some humans that see them. It also reveals more about why some people appear crazy and intent on harming others and getting them to see the creatures and die.However, it doesn't explain what the creatures are, where they're from, or how they're doing any of this - which is ok, it's not essential. But, what is essential is a lead that we can relate to, that we feel aligned with on his journey, and that person doesn't really emerge until the very end of the movie. By then you're past caring. The rest of the movie doesn't make of for the lack of a lead and a story you can relate to. Thus by the end I stayed with it just to cross the finish line but no because I cared at all about the characters.Basically, it's the story that lets this film down. They execute it well, the acting is pretty good from everyone. But, because you can't care for the lead and find him dislikable, it kind of kills the movie journey.\",\n",

The production value was good as per any good hollywood movie but what a serious waste of props and talent.

The director does not know what these things are. The sci-fi elements are completely ignored, so if you've seen the first one, there's nothing new here.The score is shockingly bad, ever-present and thematically stagnant throughout the entire runtime. The dual-language Spanish setting could have worked well, but they do absolutely nothing with it.The whole thing reeks of tax breaks.

The goal is a shelter and x amount of people die on the road to getting there... Sounds familiar? Putting the reusing of many elements from the first movie aside however, the biggest crime of this movie is its attempt to explain and put the beings in a box (hah), quite literally.As all fans of horror know, mystery is what makes something scary or at least unnerving over a period of time. Remove the mystery, and it becomes either a jumpscare-reliant horror action flick, or as in this movie\\'s case; Just a mediocre action flick. Bird Box: Barcelona is a mediocre action flick with supernatural elementsI do hope that when, if ever, we do get to see a proper sequel to Bird Box, they will be able to recreate what made the first one s\\no impactful.Returning to it not being possible to grab and imprison the \"beings\" and conduct experiments on them, would be a good start.',\n",

I won't get into spoiler territory here but I liked how they told another story which coincided with the events from the first film and told from another part of the world. I'll certainly be in the circle of people interested to see what the next addition to this franchise will be - I think there's a solid cult classic in the making here.65/100, would recommend.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Bird Box Barcelona, the much-anticipated sequel to its predecessor, falls short of expectations and fails to capture the magic of the original film. While it may still hold some appeal for fans of the science fiction and post-apocalyptic genres, it ultimately falls below the standards set by its predecessor.One of the major disappointments of Bird Box Barcelona lies in its protagonist. Unlike the first film, where viewers could empathize and root for the main character, this sequel introduces a protagonist who is difficult to connect with from the beginning. It becomes challenging to invest in their journey or even sympathize with their struggles, leaving a significant gap in the film's emotional core.Despite this setback, the performances of the actors are generally decent, although not Oscar-worthy. They manage to deliver their roles competently, but their talents are not fully utilized due to the limitations of the screenplay. It's unfortunate that the film fails to fully explore the potential of its intriguing premise, leaving the audience longing for a more captivating and developed storyline.While Bird Box Barcelona is watchable, it falls short of being a masterpiece. The film fails to capitalize on the promise of its concept, leaving viewers wanting more. It is evident that the filmmakers had the opportunity to delve into more interesting and engaging aspects of the narrative, but unfortunately, they missed the mark.In conclusion, Bird Box Barcelona is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to its predecessor's success. Despite competent performances from the cast, the film lacks the depth and development needed to truly captivate its audience. While it may still hold some interest for fans of the genre, it ultimately falls short of being the standout film that was anticipated.Regenerate response.\",\n",

I'm sure the director thought he/she were pulling great moves here, but when it goes a whole day before we see her again, it makes for a forgettable character.Then another question-mark occurs, which is why the man wants so desperately to kill the people on the bus - he acts like a newbie, and that's the least we should expect from someone like him. Sure, it creates stakes, but it establishes him as a weak protagonist - and it doesn't even get better from there.I have so many things to criticize in this film, sadly I didn't write notes - but one thing which does stand out is the great acting. I'd be satisfied watching any of these actors once more in another film, especially the people who lived under the fortress in the city.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Bird Box Barcelona: An interesting sequel set in Post-Apocalypse Barcelona, 9 months after the event. Groups of survivors struggle to eke out an existence, some groups of blind people become predators, being better adapted to the new reality. But the real predators are the Seers, those who have observed the alien creatures but have not been driven to suicide, their brains are altered, they now work on behalf of the aliens. They infiltrate survivors strongholds, expose the people to the light, make them victims of creatures. The timeline moves back and forth between the start of the invasion and the months afterwards to the film's present. More horrifying than the original because of the number and nature of suicides and killings. Some jump scares but the constant fear of light and where and when the creatures might appear injects a nice modicum of existential terror. Still with with all of the gore this is not a film for the squeamish. One group of Seers is led by a priest who has convinced himself that the aliens are angels and he is therefore doing the Lord's Work by forcing people to open their eyes to the creatures. Some scenes in the film reminded me of the 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, it's not betrayal when you can't help what you're doing. We still don't see the aliens but their presence is better portrayed with rising leaves and detritus. Bright lights and misleading voices. A tale of a quest for safety as groups make their way across a devastated city, seeking a refuge which might not exist. Watch The Skies! (But wear a blindfold.). Directed and written by Álex and David Pastor. On Netflix. 7.5/10.\",\n",

When the client Ted Garza (Kirk Acevedo) calls Elise to ask for help since he is haunted since he moved to a house in New Mexico, Elise refuses the request since the address is the same house where she spent her childhood. However she changes her mind and accepts the job, and travels with her assistants Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) to New Mexico where they will discover an evil entity in the house. \"Insidious: The Last Key\" is another spooky and scary film of this successful franchise. This ghost story is entwined with family drama of Elise and startles the viewer in many scenes. The touch of humor to break the tension is given by Tucker and Specs.

However, Insidious 4, while not the best of the series, keeps the tradition of horror storytelling alive by focusing on plot and character development rather than just plain old scares that the genre is famous for. Elise's backstory is fascinating, and helps connect some elements that were once shrouded in the mists of the unknown, and is presented nicely as past is integrated with present. In addition, while not the scariest, the group does a fantastic job utilizing shadows, make-up, and sound editing to establish a creep factor that will keep you on edge. All of this come together to make a nice mystery/horror that is worthy of the series. \\n Yet, the fourth installment still has its flaws primarily in the scare tactics, (e.g. jump scare tactics) have gotten old despite their attempts to tune it up. In addition, the plot had some dropped and rushed elements, alongside an anticlimactic wrap up, that took away from the story overall. In addition, there are a lot of scenes from the trailers missing, some of which really could have added on to the story, or allowed for more creepy makeup to be used. \\n Overall, this movie is a solid entry in the series and answers some of those lingering questions we have had since the whole prequel component was started. Yet, it does establish new questions and drops on the finish that could have really made the story exponentially better. And while the scare tactics are getting somewhat stale, Insidious is at least managing to keep things creepy and relevant to a point instead of just a super scare fest that this genre is famous for. It's worth a trip to the theater for the franchise fans, however, you can wait this out for the home cinema to save yourselves money. \\nWant more details?

       "  'comment': 'INSIDIOUS: THE LAST KEY has enough effective scares to keep the fans entertained but it will not bring in new converts though. It\\'s not the best installment out of the entire franchise but it\\'s a decent prequel that serves its purpose and that is to put further spotlight on the legacy of one of horror genre\\'s most underrated icons, actress Lin Shaye.Brought to you by the same creative minds behind \"Insidious\" trilogy, this fourth installment, Insidious: The Last Key takes you back to the beginning, to the family history of renowned parapsychologist, Dr. Elise Rainer and how the haunting in her own family home has returned with a vengeance. It is up to Elise and her spectral sighting team to defeat this demon once and for all. Even though Insidious: The Last Key is directed by somebody new to the franchise, Adam Robitel, much of the style follows suit with its predecessors, so in a way, this movie is very formulaic, the objective is the same which is to present to you a big bad villain in a form of a demon at the end of the story and that\\'s not really a spoiler because the other movies did the same thing. Because this is a prequel, it takes its time in setting the whole thing up in terms of Elise\\'s family and the abuse she and her brother endured when they were kids. This part, these flashbacks are just as creepy, if not creepier than what\\'s happening in the present day with Elise trying to communicate with spirits in the dark. By the way, actress Lin Shaye has been in this business and specifically has been part of this genre forever, so as a fan, it really is cool to see a movie like this that allows her to showcase her all, that gives her room and space to do what she does best, in a way, they might as well have titled this movie, Insidious The Lin Shaye lifetime achievement award.I actually enjoyed how the film presents Elise\\'s background, the whole theme of it kinda resonates with any kid who grows up feeling different and the parents try to beat it out of you instead of helping you embrace your specialty and uniqueness. So that approach does help in making you empathize with Elise which is an effective strategy in any horror film because the jump scares can only do so much, what\\'s truly scary is when you feel scared for the safety of the characters whose journey you\\'ve been following, and that\\'s what Insidious: The Last Key offers. I\\'m also mildly amused by the comic relief of Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson who play Elise\\'s sidekicks, granted some of the humor does feel a bit dumb but they mean well, so it\\'s one of those that just make you shake your head and dismiss them as immature children. Insidious The Last Key is scary enough, it\\'s entertaining enough for the fans, it\\'s a popcorn horror thriller you\\'d want to take your girlfriend to see just so that she can curl up next to you when she feels squeamish, this really is a movie just for the fans of the franchise, and despite some of its few ridiculous scenes, I think overall they\\'re going to be grateful that this installment exists.-- Rama\\'s Screen --',\n",

       "  'comment': '(Some spoiler free views about the movie)Insidious : Chapter 3 wasn\\'t enough of an unnecessary addition to the Insidious franchise, so we got this one. This one does have some good elements in it, and definitely more of the bad ones. All in all, the film felt like a below average \"horror\" film. This film really felt underwhelming to me, and I already had very less expectations. If the franchise is to proceed further (no pun intended), they need to change the direction or reboot it. But the best thing would be to stop it right here. On my own scale, I would give it a \"4.1/10\" score. And on the usual A+ to F scale, it would get a \"D+\".(Discussion about how I personally felt about the movie)Good : What this film does good is it adds some more depth to the character of Elise. They give the back story and all, along with some \"origins\" of Elise. Her character moments are quite good. Some jump-scares, particularly one or two, were good ones. And ... that\\'s it. Mixed : None of the parts were \"mixed\", just good or bad. Bad : The remaining of the film, just like the third one, felt more like a typical \"haunted house\" story, rather than an \"Insidious\" film. The concept of astral projection they brought in the first film has been turned into a mere plot device ever since the third one, this fourth installment clearly isn\\'t an exception. Honestly, I feel that is the thing that made the first two films what they were. And the way \"The Further\" works has been quite a bit ludicrous ever since the second one, the ludicrousness increased in the third one and now in this one, everything convenient to the plot can be done in \"The Further\". Just like astral projection, this is just a plot device now. And nothing is explained about how the things work to stop that demon. It was just \"you\\'re watching a horror film, so anything that we do for our convenience, you should accept it, no matter we build it or not\" sort of bullshit. The jokes that the two \"sidekicks\" of Elise crack were CRINGE-WORTHY. Just some perverted moments time and again, some unnecessary bullshit, most of the comedic parts feel out of place and did not match the tone of the film. And even though the jokes and all that stupid stuff felt out of place, this film felt like a comedy more than horror. Speaking of horror, it just had jump-scares, none of which made a real sense. Remove them, nothing is \"horror\". Also, some predictable and obvious \"Insidious\" twists at some places, which no longer feel appealing. Also, \"The Last Key\" ..... I am still wondering what was so special about the key, except for Elise giving the demon the last key. It was just a demon who manipulated Elise\\'s father and had fingers made up of keys which served some vague purpose not explained in the movie. The demon when appears in some jump-scares, it scares (at least). But when it really shows up, nothing is speacial about it. So, where\\'s the horror? Scaring and terrifying are different things, and for a good horror film, most of us prefer the terrifying stuffs. The presence of demon serves no purpose? And he\\'s the only demon?!! And how is that blowing a whistle calls Elise\\'s mother to rescue her and a single kick kills the demon? (If only it had some purpose and some story added to the part of the demon like in the first two, it might have worked.) Also, what\\'s with her Elise\\'s dad\\'s spirit dying in \"The Further\"? There are many such questions unanswered by the film and this is not obviously an \"Inception-themed\" or \"Memento-themed\" movie, this was just an incomprehensible mess of a movie. Then, there\\'s a scene of Elise opening the boxes to realize the killings her father committed, where we were teased of jump-scares, and we didn\\'t get a jump-scare at the first time, and after a couple of stupid teasings we get a jump-scare. And if the makers thought we won\\'t be able to predict what they were doing in this scene, they\\'re fools. See? A scene committed to an unnecessary jump-scare, but nothing done to give some actual horror. Doesn\\'t that prove that horror film makers don\\'t know what horror is? And where\\'s that man dressed as bride in a black dress trying to kill Elise, which was supposed to follow her every time she went into \"The Further\"? The film ties up with the events of the first one, which clearly creates some plot holes as the entire film was about astral projection but the way this film ties it up shows as if it was something similar to this film, making this more of a nonsense. In fact, the best part of this film is that it had some scenes from the first Insidious film, which reminded me how good the first two were. Rest of all, unnecessary crap.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"In 1953, Elise Rainier lives with her loving mother, her abusive prison guard father, and her young brother Christian next to the prison. Her father beats her for claiming to see the dead and locks her in the basement. She unlocks a forbidding red door allowing a demon to escape and getting her mother killed. In 2010 California, Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) fights paranormal demons with Specs and Tucker. She gets a call for help from Ted Garza who lives in her childhood home in New Mexico. She reluctantly goes home and finds her estranged angry brother Christian (Bruce Davison) with two daughters Imogen (Caitlin Gerard) and Melissa (Spencer Locke).There are some issues with clarity. This starts with the flashback to her childhood home. In retrospect, it doesn't make sense that her father would lock her in the basement so that she could easily find the secret entrance to the dungeon. The house layout is never that clear with a question of how the kids wouldn't figure things out sooner over the many years. The same can be said about Garza. Why would he call Elise for help unless he wants to be discovered? Is it self-sabotage? There is a great reveal but it needs to be the central take. It's all a bit messy. As for the characters, I like Elise but not the boys especially Tucker. The girls are fine. I do like The Further but I don't get why Imogen has to throw the whistle to Elise. Couldn't Imogen blow it herself? It's a lot of nagging little questions. In the end, I like it more than I have problems.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"From the very beginning of this series, their jump scares are based on loud, blaring music, and its annoying. No wonder you'll get a fright...Was it scary? Hmf... Was it interesting? Hmf... Did it offer anything new? Hmf... I'm so not an 'Insidious' fan, I'm really not. Although it was atmospheric and creepy, the story itself just wasn't interesting enough. This film, which is a prequel prequel, goes back to Elise's childhood and we learn more about her. Some of these events are only clearer after the reveal in the final act, which was an interesting reveal. Bearing that in mind, the film could - and should - have been a suspenseful drama thriller instead of a horror.Lin Shaye carries the movie, and she does it very well. She's a great actress and I actually enjoy her in the film. Her sidekicks, though, should have been eliminated. They are unfunny idiots who ruin the film's suspense. These comical moments were oh-so-American and insanely annoying and out of place.As much as they (obviously) tried, I just wasn't really moved by the film. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad film. It is very well made with good and creepy visuals. For some reason I just don't connect with these 'Insidious' films, as hard as I try. I don't think I'm going to remember this...\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'I\\'ve said it before and I\\'ll say it again, when it comes to horror Hollywood has lost its way. As demonstrated with franchises like Insidious, the Conjuring, Paranormal Activity and the countless standalone snorefests.Just to give you some perspective about what I think of Insidious let\\'s put it like this, 4 movies with a potential 40 stars total. Including the Last Key it\\'s 8/40. These movies really are the pits.So another prequel to the franchise see\\'s the excellent Lin Shaye lead again, this time with veteran Bruce Davison in tow (Who is sadly not used anywhere near enough). The plot is that she\\'s on a job in the house she grew up in and supernatural investigations take place and yadayadayada.If you\\'ve seen the other films you\\'ll know exactly what to expect. Generic scares, mediocre plot and pseudo \"Other side\" boredom. Seriously, are people that disillusioned that they think this is the pinnacle of horror cinema?Sure they look good, they have a budget behind them and both Shaye and Davison are fantastic but the film has absolutely nothing original, interesting or entertaining about it.When it comes to horror watch independent, Hollywood just don\\'t have a clue anymore.The Good:Lin Shaye and Bruce DavisonThe Bad:Same.......old.......tripe',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Few horror franchises have found life beyond their third chapter, and \"Insidious\" proves no different.Picking up right after the events of \"Insidious: Chapter 3\", this fourth entry further (pun intended) explores the backstory of demonologist Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye), who was murdered in a memorable twist at the end of the first film. Here, Elise is first introduced as a young girl living in a foreboding two-storey house on the outskirts of a New Mexico prison in 1952 where her stern father (Josh Stewart) works as a prison guard. Turns out that Elise already had a gift (or curse, depending on which way you look at it) for seeing ghosts then, but when she disobeys her father\\'s order to deny her paranormal abilities, he locks her in the basement. It is there she first encounters this movie\\'s demon - a tall lanky beast with old-timey keys for fingers - and unknowingly unlocks a mysterious red door for the monster to cross over into our world.Back in the present day, Elise receives a phone call from a stranger who asks for her help with the ghosts in his house. That house turns out to be her childhood home, and despite her initial reservations at literally revisiting past demons, she eventually musters up the courage to confront what she recognises she had previously unleashed. It helps that she isn\\'t alone; thanks to the events in the last movie, she is now accompanied by a pair of dopey sidekicks Tucker (Angus Sampson) and Specs (Leigh Whannell). To be sure, their signature high-tech gizmos aren\\'t of much use (certainly much less than they were in the first two movies), so their presence is really as comic relief - like Tucker loves to repeat, \"She\\'s psychic; we\\'re sidekick.\" What distinguished \"Insidious\" from other haunted-house movies was its creation of \\'The Further\\', a terrifying place between life and death that exists on a different realm from ours where evil spirits trapped not just the souls of the dead but also those who were able to project themselves astrally while asleep. Elise was established to be one such individual, and it isn\\'t reasonable that she would quickly return to \\'The Further\\' in order to seek out the entity which had terrorised her and is terrorising the house\\'s current inhabitant as well as the spirits she sees around the property. But Whannell, who had written every one of the \"Insidious\" movies, has other intentions; in fact, the middle act sees Elise come face-to-face with a different real-life horror, which while well-intentioned, is not nearly as developed as it needs to be and is hardly as interesting as the ghouls of \\'The Further\\'. Only in the final act does Elise finally return to that purgatory, but that homecoming is over too fast, too soon and too conveniently, almost as if it were simply an afterthought to form a narrative bridge into the first movie.Even though the earlier \\'Insidious\\' films had similarly spare scripts, they benefited from the taut direction of James Wan, who knew how to build perfectly good scares with icy dread. Unfortunately, series newcomer Adam Robitel doesn\\'t quite have the same knack. Not only is he able to generate the same atmosphere as Wan did, Robitel often betrays his own lack of confidence by resorting to the sort of jump-cuts which quickly tire out. This being his sophomore feature, he also lacks the experience to properly smooth over the rough edges of Whannell\\'s writing - in particular, the parts intended to be poignant, such as Elise\\'s estrangement from her skittish younger brother Christian (Bruce Davison), come off feeling contrived and sit awkwardly with the rest of the parts designed to frighten.Ultimately, it is Shaye who holds the rickety film together, portraying Elise with just the right balance of vulnerability and fearlessness. While it may seem opportunistic that the \"Insidious\" series goes down the same road as \"The Conjuring\" (by using the same parapsychologist(s) across its entries), Shaye very much holds her own as the film\\'s septuagenarian heroine. That said, it is not quite nearly enough to reinvigorate the franchise itself, which seems imprisoned in its own creative limits and cannot quite go any further (that\\'s another pun, fully intended). Perhaps its title is ominous of its fate, and even if \\'The Last Key\\' isn\\'t the last we hear of \"Insidious\", then the next chapter better have a much more compelling raison d\\'être.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"The 'Insidious' series has always been a funny one for me. I've enjoyed every film in it (up until this fourth edition) without ever falling in love with it like I did 'Saw' or 'Paranormal Activity' or 'The Conjuring' series. The concept to me just isn't that good. Only the high quality with which they were being made kept me entertained by them. Now though in this fourth edition 'Insidious: The Last Key' they've finally jumped the shark. They no longer have any thing of value to add to the horror genre.The film only has jump-scares going for it in the way of horror and even most of those don't work. There was only really one that got me in the entire film and that was near the end when I thought things were over in that respect (plus it used the best element the entire series has produced - I won't say but if you know the series you'll know what I'm talking about). As far as building tension or atmosphere goes though there basically is none. Firstly, every thing just feels way too safe for these characters. They're too well established for anything bad to actually happen to them. Secondly, the film is bordering on a comedy at times with the amount of humour it is trying to force in. It's all well and good to have a laugh or two thrown in the mix (and there are a few good chuckles), but when it completely takes you out of any tense mood that you're supposed to be in then it becomes a problem. The best horror movies have limited to no humour in them.The film really just didn't work for me. I was purely bored through most of it. If they do make a fifth one (let's be honest, they almost certainly will) then they need to mix it up a bit. Change up the formula, get some new characters in and get everyone in a situation where they are in genuine danger and all bets are off the table. It all feels far too much like the 'Poltergeist' remake at the moment, and we all know that's one of my least favourite films of all time. Stay away from this one.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Insidious: The Last Key is the fourth installment of hit franchise. While the first two movies revolve around Josh Lambert & family. The third & fourth installments mainly revolve around Elise Rainier & her encounters with supernatural elements.\\nThe movie starts off in the year 1953. Elise Rainier (Ava Kolker) is a young girl, who stays with her brother & parents. She has this innate gift/curse of seeing ghosts & speaking to them. While her mother understands her situation & is compassionate towards her, her father is completely annoyed with this weird ability. A childhood incident leads to disastrous results. Elise Rainier leaves her home & starts life afresh away from her family. She then grows up to be an accomplished ghost buster. \\nSeveral years later, she gets a call from the new occupant of her house. The new occupant has been facing the wrath of the supernatural forces lurking in his house. He hopes that Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) will help him out. Psychic Elise is joined by her two sidekicks (watch the movie to get the joke) - Tucker (Angus Sampson) & Specs (Leigh Whannell). These two are the comic relief in the movie. What follows is a series of spooky incidents, which will keep you at the edge of your seats. The movie does have its share of emotional scenes. Family reunions post several years, strength of a mother's love for her kids are aspects on which the makers rely on to create an emotional bond with the viewers. There are enough twists & turns to keep you guessing. There were some twists, which no one can probably see coming.\\nThe script follows the usual crest & trough pattern. There are a few scenes which take the story further, followed by some horror scenes & again some scenes to take the story further. Thankfully, there are more crests than troughs. The horror quotient in this movie is very high. It did manage to scare us & the effects did manage to startle us. The movie is scarier than the latest movie from the Annabelle series. Producer James Wan is truly a genius. His collaboration with Leigh Whannell has always managed to impress us. Leigh Whannell acts, scripts & produces the movie as well. Music by Joseph Bishara does manage to accentuate the effect of the horror scenes. The acting by the cast is good. \\nThere are no flaws in the movie to speak of. Although we were a tad unhappy with the way the movie ended. The ending could have been scripted better.\\nBut, we strongly recommend this movie to all horror movie aficionados. Do watch it at a theatre near you!\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Insidious: The Last Key (2018) *** (out of 4)Dr. Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) receives a phone call from a man asking for her help. The only thing is that he's living in her childhood home where she is still traumatized from events that happened there. She decides to fight her fears and return to the house but soon she realizes that an event from her past might explain her current situation.INSIDIOUS: THE LAST KEY seems to have gotten a lot of negative reviews from critics and fans but I personally thought it was a lot better than the third film in the series and on the whole I thought it was very entertaining. With that said, there's no question that there were some major flaws with the picture but at the same time the film managed to be quite creepy at times and this here made up for any other issues.Director Adam Robitel is certainly the star of the picture because he does a wonderful job at building up the tension. Wes Craven once gave an interview where he talked about tension and he said that you have to know how long to have a build up to a scare last. If you reveal the scare too soon you cheap seconds worth of tension. If you drag the build up too far then the scene will lose its impact. I kept think of Craven's thoughts while watching this movie because the scare scenes here are perfectly built up and executed. You curl up knowing something is about to happen but Robitel makes you have fun waiting for the scare to come.I also liked that the film brought some family drama into the matter. I thought the opening sequence was extremely effective as were some of the later scenes between Rainier and her brother. The performances were a mixed bag but for the most part I thought they were good enough for this type of picture with Shaye turning in a fine performance and I thought a very believable as well. As I said, there were some major issues with the film including the finale fifteen-minutes. I really didn't like how the film ended and I thought there were some issues with the story that never really got worked out. I'd also argue that the final ghoul wasn't at all creepy and this hurt the film. In fact, lets just say that everything that happens at the end is just a major letdown. I'd also argue that the comic attempt was pretty bland and didn't work at all.With all of that being said, INSIDIOUS: THE LAST KEY was an effective horror film for what it was and it's certainly worth watching.\",\n",

Characters will make decisions in one scene, only to inexplicably decide the exact opposite in the following scene. Most of the suspenseful scenes feel ripped straight from the previous entries in the franchise (or from other similar series like the Conjuring or Ouija). Worst of all, The Last Key seems to feel the need to remind of you of the other Insidious films and previous scenes with needless flashbacks and reincorporation. The humor is often misplaced, pacing is disjointed, but at least the score will be sure to remind you of when you're supposed to be scared.Despite some cool looking sets, there is little to enjoy in this film.

The film takes place a year after the events of the third film and follows Elise as she travels to New Mexico to revisit her old home in order to help a man from a deadly spirit that she says, she brought into the world. I remember having a hunch for Insidious: The Last Key that I would think it would be ok and when I watched it, a few minutes ago, I really enjoyed it. Lin Shaye again in this film is bonkers to believe she leads this whole entire thing as a 74 year old woman, Leigh Whannell and the other guy are also really good. The only problem I had with the film, like many, were the very cringy jokes that did not work, if they werent in this, it would have been a bit better but they planted a butt load of them in so I had to give it an 8, another thing was the monster in the film, I think this was another issue but I felt the monster had barely any screen time and I also felt he was really rushed all and all but overall though, Insidious: The Last Key is a really good horror film, brilliant acting, brilliant scares and a really good creepy monster!',\n",

What will happen to her?\"San Andreas\" is a popcorn disaster movie, a genre that was usual in the 70\\'s, but with state-of-art special effects. Unfortunately, the lame and corny story is ridiculous. Ray uses the helicopter to rescue his wife and daughter and destroy it. He steals a pickup truck; an airplane from the hangar; and a boat to save his daughter apparently with no consequences. His ex-wife Emma resolves all her issues with Ray in the middle of the chaos. There is no cell phone, but the fixed-line telephone works perfectly despite the destruction and havoc. Blake, Ben and Ollie save the film. There is a tsunami and Ray drives the motor boat in the middle of the debris and possible survivors as if he were in a race. In the end, love is beautiful! My vote is six.Title (Brazil): \"Terremoto: A Falha de San Andreas\"(\"Earthquake: The San Andreas Fault\")',\n",

Who didn't know there were going to be many unbelievable scenes? Who didn't know there would be some cheesy dialogue? Well, I, for one, enjoyed it. The last good disaster movie I saw was The Towering Inferno, and you know that was a long, long time ago. It's still my favorite disaster flick. San Andreas, of course, had much better special effects. (several decades later, better effects, right?) I thought the scenes of the destruction were amazing. We all know disaster movies usually focus on a handful of people in it and this one was no different. The movie was entertaining for me. I hope it is for you, too. :)\",\n",

He's kinda good in this, I like him, even when he's part of this manipulative propaganda. The special effects were nice. It kinda flowed, sort of, I guess, lots of plot holes but why bother looking for them when the iq level they're aiming this at is so low you're not supposed to notice.

       "  'comment': 'San Andreas (2015) *** (out of 4) After a massive earthquake strikes California, a father (Dwayne Johnson) must struggle to try and rescue his estranged wife (Carla Gugino) and his daughter (Alexandra Daddario) who finds herself somewhere in San Fransisco. While people are trying to dig themselves out of the damage, a seismologist (Paul Giamatti) warns people that the big one hasn\\'t yet happened.SAN ANDREAS is without question one of the dumbest movies that you\\'re going to see in the year 2015 or perhaps any other year. I mean, things happen here that are without question quite stupid and that includes a really dumb love story and the logic of some of the scenes are downright laughable. With that said, one really shouldn\\'t go into this movie expecting anything other than a popcorn movie meant to keep you entertained and this film certainly does that as it\\'s a pretty good throwback to the Irwin Allen disaster pictures like EARTHQUAKE, THE TOWERING INFERNO and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.I really can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this but the special effects are certainly the highlight of the picture. I\\'m usually not a fan of CGI because more times than not it just looks fake and takes away from the story but we\\'re reaching a point in technology where it\\'s really hard to see the effect, which is just great. There\\'s a massive amount of destruction throughout this film and I must admit that the effects make you feel that everything you\\'re watching is real. This includes the actual earthquake footage as well as all the destruction around the state. There are countless buildings that fall and the aftermath of the quake looks extremely realistic.The story itself is quite stupid as we get all sorts of predictable scenes but I can\\'t really blame the film for this as the entire disaster genre had silly melodrama going on. The relationship issues between Johnson and Gugino are quite stupid and of course there\\'s a side story dealing with him not being able to save a daughter that died. The screenplay pretty much throws everything into the mix and just hopes any of it sticks. Again, it\\'s hard to bash the \"dumb\" story too much since the film is so entertaining but I will give the film credit for delivering the highest body count in the history of cinema.Again, going into SAN ANDREAS expecting anything other than entertainment probably isn\\'t the best idea. The actors are all entertaining in their own right and that\\'s especially true for Daddario. As far as Johnson goes, he\\'s certainly not the greatest actor in the world but he makes for a great action star.',\n",

The story line and plot wasn't anything spectacular. It wasn't anything you haven't seen before, very clichéd and predictable. The Rock's performance in this film did give it that extra kick that was needed to make this film a bit more tolerable. If you're planning on seeing this film enjoy the ride for the visual effects and the action, don't expect very much more. I'm not going to say it's bad and I'm not going to say it's good.

However, I hope you're not expecting any earth shattering (no pun intended) dialogue or storyline, because the filmmakers here have taken every plot cliché and hokey line of dialogue and thrown it into this movie.All in all, this film, directed by Brad Peyton, with a screenplay from Carlton Cuse, is just an escape filled with one tension packed scene after another, but don't be surprised if you find yourself unintentionally laughing out loud with some of the cheesy dialogue and plot elements.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"My love of the disaster genre means that I can enjoy this type of movie despite the myriad problems with it, alongside the inherent cheesiness and the poor writing which makes it laughable in places. It pales in comparison to stuff from the 1970s like THE TOWERING INFERNO and EARTHQUAKE, but it's certainly better than modern SyFy Channel and Asylum offerings, even if that's just because of the massive budget alone.The story is written so that the disaster scenes keep occurring throughout the movie. The CGI effects work is extensive, but it's also pretty good, and certainly better than in the awful 2012. Yes, you get all the flag-waving nonsense associated with this type of film, but you also get plenty of suspense scenes and depictions of post-earthquake devastation that you don't usually get to see in the movies.Dwayne Johnson continues to be a hulking, mildly charismatic presence in the movies, although he's no Schwarzenegger. Alexandra Daddario is there for her looks and certainly succeeds in that respect. The rest of the cast don't fare so well, with Ioan Gruffudd virtually reprising his role from SANCTUM and Paul Giamatti on autopilot, although at least we get to find out what happened to Art Parkinson (the disappearing Rickon Stark from TV's GAME OF THRONES). SAN ANDREAS is certainly undemanding entertainment, and not a film I'm in any hurry to sit through again, but compared to other offerings in this packed sub-genre, it's not THAT bad.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'My first experience in the UltraScreen®DLX with massive screen, Dreamlounger\\x99 leather reserved recliners, and Dolby Atmos immersive sound with bass you can feel (it\\'s true), was none other than to see San Andreas. If you haven\\'t been following my reviews this summer, my goal is to review all of the summer blockbusters on cheap movie days for $5.My first surprise was that the seats are reserved. You get to pick your seat, although there were few left to choose from when I arrived. The second surprise was that the chairs are power recliners, so you just push a button and wham you go back and your legs go up. The third surprise was a smell I hadn\\'t smelled in years, not since junior high locker room. It was a mix of people who don\\'t like to shower, don\\'t like to wash their gym clothes, and wet tile. Then a nice young couple who dry humped the whole movie sat next to me and at least she was wearing a strong perfume that mostly covered up the smell.But I digress. What about this disaster movie? It features a family (that apparently has no last name, at least not that I ever learned, nor is there any last name listed for them in the credits, so I will call them Family #1), a pretty family, an upper-middle-class family that is going through a rather benign divorce and Emma causes trouble immediately because she is moving in with a richy rich dude (who has a last name, because he\\'s Daniel Riddick), a thoroughly loathsome man incapable of love except for buildings.Ray is solid as a rock, he\\'s something sturdy, like a real man, someone you can cling to or hold on to no matter what. He loves his daughter, Blake, very much, because he blames himself for the death of his other daughter, whom we eventually learn died while rafting. You see, Ray is a professional rescue-chopper pilot, so the death of his daughter is as much personal as it was a professional blunder.The main problem with this disaster movie is that Family #1 is split in two groups, and there is no real belief that any of them will ever actually die, although San Andreas does feature Blake enduring the longest non-death sequence I\\'ve ever seen. In better disaster movies, like the original Poseidon Adventure (it\\'s unfortunate that I have to clarify the \"original\" Poseidon Adventure) the protagonists are traipsing and shambling through the disaster together, and they drop like flies until the very end, when only a handful of the worthy and fortunate survive.The acting in San Andreas isn\\'t bad, and it\\'s not good. It\\'s extremely okay. Poor Paul Giamatti, who seems typecast as himself these days.Things blow up, collapse, and fall apart real good. The special effects are pretty amazing and realistic. It\\'s nice to see so many Californians perish as a precursor to the Great Water Wars of 2016. In fact, even though Ray is a civil servant responsible for saving lives, he tries to fly the chopper from L.A. to San Francisco to save his daughter instead of trying to save anyone in Los Angeles or elsewhere along the way. He _does_, however, trade a stolen pickup for directions to an airfield, which I suppose is a fair trade and shows he\\'s a Really Good Guy.There is a bit of adventure. Ray commandeers trains and boats and planes. Well, no trains. That would\\'ve been pretty cool to drive a train through an earthquake. A simple oversight, I suppose. Nevertheless, I sensed the feeling of excitement at the thought of being in a real disaster, stealing whatever vehicles were around to go wherever I wanted. And it\\'s nice to see a lot of chopper scenes in a movie. There should be more chopper scenes in every movie.Forget the millions of Californians who died or were dying along the way. All we care about are a handful of pretty, well-off people trying to survive the worst earthquake in human history. We rarely see anyone die, because they get swooped up or down or crushed. No bones, no blood, no limbs flying everywhere. It\\'s pretty WASPish death, as people disappear in clouds of dust, never to be seen or heard from again.Despite all the Californian death and destruction, Americans can be jingoistically proud to see a final flowing flag confirming we are the best nation-state on Earth, and we will rebuild it all for the next disaster.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Another reviewer on IMDb gave this a 10/10 and they said that this was all the best parts of every disaster movie you\\'ve ever seen. That\\'s not too far from the truth. It has been a long, long, LONG time since we have had a terrific disaster flick. Nowadays its all about the special effects and it becomes so ridiculous that you lose sight of what made disaster movies so great. San Andreas still goes for the jugular of modern day special effects but it also goes back to the disaster roots and uses all the familiar recipe ingredients to ensure this is ferociously enjoyable and it is!! It will never win Oscars (not including special effects) and its not some critical masterpiece but it is purely entertainment. It is the sort of popcorn, theatre flick that we rarely see anymore. Its the type of movie that reminds you why we all fell in love with movies. I smiled, I cringed, I cried out loud, I teared up...it was remarkable. I could watch this again and again without hesitation. The characters might be typical and some of the scenes predictable but it has been so long since someone got the disaster movie recipe right that I loved every minute of it. This is as much of an homage to the 70\\'s Disaster era as it is a modern day spectacle of effects.Dwayne Johnson (in my books) went from ridiculous WWE wrestling that I haven\\'t watched since I was 12 to trying his hand at acting and becoming the next big Hollywood star. In fact, he might be one of the only young Hollywood stars in recent years that I really enjoy watching him kick some serious butt. He has an incredible charisma on screen and he\\'s just very likable and a great \"every-man\\'s\" hero. He is perfect in this part and defines hero. Carla Gugino plays Johnson\\'s estranged soon-to-be ex-wife. She plays a great part and her and Johnson seem like an odd couple and yet as their characters develop they are believable together and terrific. Alexandra Daddario is terrific as Johnson\\'s daughter. First of all, she is gorgeous but she is also very down to earth, a great heroine, and very believable. She stands right up there with Johnson and gets noticed. Hugo Johnstone-Burt, Art Parkinson, Ioan Gruffudd and Paul Giamatti round out the supporting cast and literally all of them are terrific in their own way. They all have at least one or two scenes that are really great and the movie wouldn\\'t be the same without them.Director Brad Peyton has done everything right with this film. He goes for the emotions, the intensity, the realism and for all the previous Earthquake films this one takes the cake. Remember the classic Disaster film \"Earthquake\"? That was scary. San Andreas obliterates modern society and you believe it. You can\\'t help but imagine what this would be like. It is one nail-biting, insane moment after another. The CGI is spot on (and I HATE CGI) but this was nearly perfect. Ironically, the only time the CGI was bad (really bad) was in a scene near the end with them in a boat. The Quake, the disaster itself, the Tsunami and the Hoover Dam scenes were amazing. If you\\'re going into this looking for all the reasons why it isn\\'t perfect then you\\'ll find some. I went in looking for a good time and man did I find that in spades!! Incredibly entertaining, a terrific time at the movies and another huge 2015 blockbuster!!! 10/10',\n",

But that's enough about buxom beauty Alexandra Daddario in her tight vest\\x85 what about the rest of the film?Well, San Andreas delivers precisely what one might expect from a big-budget disaster movie starring Dwayne' The Rock' Johnson: a scientist (Paul Giamatti) who tries to warn of the impending disaster; a strained relationship between hero Ray (Johnson) and his tasty wife Emma (Carla Gugino), which will, of course, be resolved before the end credits roll; the destruction of several famous landmarks; a resourceful, plucky daughter (Daddario) who has learnt all she knows from her resourceful, plucky father; numerous narrow escapes for all of the main characters, from falling buildings, explosions, crashing vehicles, and tidal waves; impressive CGI effects that pervade almost every single frame; and a nasty character who gets what he deserves (a container ship on his head!). In short, San Andreas delivers almost all of the expected clichés of the genre—all that's missing is a cute dog saved from the jaws of death in the nick of time.It's highly preposterous and predictable Hollywood nonsense the likes of which we have seen many times before, but it is sufficiently loud, chaotic, and expertly executed to be worth the price of a ticket for most disaster movie fans.My favourite moments (apart from Daddario sunbathing in her bikini and her underwater swim, that is): the ground breaking open and a tube train spilling out onto the streets of San Fransisco, and the big surprise waiting for Ray and Emma at the top of the tidal wave.7.5 out of 10, happily rounded up to 8 for—you guessed it—Alexandra Daddario.\",\n",

It shows an entire city not only being hit by the biggest and strongest earthquake in history but then hit by a three hundred foot high tsunami that finishes the job. This is the disaster movie of disaster movies. No need for a strong story here. The special effects provide more than enough drama. The actual characters in the movie are ancillary to the story. It's about nature going wild, and on a scale that is beyond measuring. At the conclusion of the movie, San Francisco is a mess. Paul Giamatti is fantastic, and also quite amusing, as the scientist who predicts that the earthquake will strike - and nobody believes him until it is too late. By that time, the Hoover Dam is history and the rest of California is next in line. LA also gets hit, hard, but the director saves the best special effects for San Francisco. If you like movies that show total devastation, then this movie is for you. This movie delivers, or rather obliterates the goods!\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. Seeing the images in 3-D, this was pretty exciting but if there weren't characters we cared about, I don't think this would have been as good. Dwayne Johnson is fine as the hero saving his family during an earthquake with ex-wife Carla Gugino-who previously appeared with him in Race to Witch Moountain and Faster-also playing a true heroine-helping when needed. Their daughter also proves her mettle when she gets involved with a couple of British brothers-one close to her age and his little brother-in helping them survive. Paul Giamatti is fine as the scientist who explains to his colleagues-therefore us-how serious things are as they happen. Oh, and I guess Ioan Gruffudd-who I always first think of as Reed Richards-Mr. Fantastic-in the Fantastic Four movie I saw a decade ago-is basically-well, not a villain but a jerk of a character who leaves his stepdaughter-or is she since I can't remember if he was even married to Ms. Gugino-when she was at her most danger! Didn't surprise me what happened to him! Anyway, me and my friend highly enjoyed San Andreas.\",\n",

It's sad that this movie earned more than Blade Runner 2049.I know it's meant to be a popcorn flick, but the dialogues were awful and moronic. The screenplay was written by a mentally underdeveloped person. At least 2012 wasn't THIS dumb. This was a great unintentional comedy. Also, Alexandra Daddario is a terrible actress.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Possibly the worst \"disaster\" movie since the Poseiden Adventure.Makes the DAY AFTER TOMORROW (which actually was not a bad film) look like Oscar material.Horrible script. Horrible direction. Horrible special effects. The actors struggle, really and painfully struggle, to distinguish themselves in this \"pot luck dinner\" pretending to be a spectacle pretending to be an A-List movie, pretending to be entertainment.If you watch a lot of movies, you get used to the visual cues, the angles and sequences that directors use to bridge to the next big scene.Right off the top of this film -- at a stage where I really wanted to like the film, to enjoy it -- a quake rocks the Hoover Dam and forces Paul Giamatti and his fellow scientist to run for their lives. Giamatti makes it, and the other guy almost makes it but at the last second stops to help a young girl.Carrying the girl, the other scientist once again tries to make it to safety but, as he runs, the asphalt around him shatters. The visual cues indicated something big was coming, but the possibilities were limited. I remember thinking, the only result that would justify these angles and the suspense buildup would be if the gets the girl to safety but dies himself....? Sure enough, he has just enough energy to \"toss\" the girl to safety -- sorta like a football -- as he himself gets his spine shattered by the quake catching up to him.At that point, this movie and I were no longer pals.A few minutes later, there is a scene where Dwayne Johnson\\'s \"young daugther,\" played by 30 year old Alexandra Daddario -- whom one IMDb reviewer suggested \"should try a porn film\" -- is parked in an office lobby and treated like a 15 year old. Was that in the script? Was she playing younger? Did she win the part in a game show? Or, is that scene merely typical of the general lack of consistency one has to expect if you have to sit through this film right to the end? I suggest the latter. You have been warned.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'If you understand what a disaster movie is about and how it works you will go and have a nice experience just as I did, certainly superior to the \"2012\" or \"Day After Tomorrow\" dullness.The usual cheesiness in disaster movie is there, the characters are so stereotypical it\\'s hardly believable and worst of all it commits the usual, stupid mistake of having characters make it out of a situation just in time before everything collapses. This mistakes really annoys me firstly because it repeats itself a dozen times in the film but most of all because it\\'s worthless: it does not add stakes or tension, they would be exactly the same, but except for maybe twice in the film situations get resolved just in time and the uselessness of it really annoyed me. The film tries too hard to give it\\'s characters depth and barely succeeds in it. I cannot deny I was rooting for them, that maybe being due to the fact that the actors involved are honestly all doing a good enough job, but the fact that it tries to achieve character empathy through clichés that have been present in cinema since the beginning of time is ridiculous.That being said, it does deliver the goods of a disaster movie and delivers them much more competently than the recent disaster films we have seen on the big screen. With the exception of the finale where things are unnecessarily blown up to eleven, there isn\\'t exaggeration. The set pieces are for the major part breath-taking and original enough. I counted actually two times where my mouth totally dropped in genuine amazement. I was riveted by many scenes and this is probably due to the fact that the director never overuses CGI. It is used in the perfect dose, there is enough practicality involved and the fact that the set pieces aren\\'t always the biggest most blown up ones made it better, it gave the film more stakes. Moreover there is a great use of long takes in certain parts of the film, one in particular is very long and threw me right into the action like no other disaster movie ever had done before.If you know what you are in for you will have a good time and you will be given back your money\\'s worth, you won\\'t want to be re-watching this movie anytime, but that is perfectly fine and fits the film in what it is trying to achieve.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'San Andreas is a spectacular disaster film that blends breathtaking special effects with heart rending personal stories of incredible power. An overwhelming saga of a state devastated by monstrous earthquakes, resulting in stunning vistas of unprecedented destruction so vast that they are difficult to emotionally process. Technically, there is no doubt this is a brilliantly made and directed movie. However, it is the human element that creates the tension and suspense as characters for whom we care struggle for survival against a panorama of immense ruin. Carla Gugino shines as the wife of Dwayne Johnson, giving a moving performance of tremendous power as a woman desperate to save her family. Gugino lights up every scene in which she appears and the camera loves her. Johnson does well in his part as a helicopter pilot and first responder who faces the greatest challenge of his professional and personal life. A film that serves as a quite profound cautionary tale as well as a story of high adventure, San Andreas is a superb film that succeeds as a drama as well as the finest disaster movie to come out of Hollywood in decades.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Ray goes to pick up daughter Blake to take her back to college from the house where soon-to-be-ex-wife Emma is about to move in with mega-rich Daniel Riddick. Blake would like her parents to get back together but is being sensible about it, Ray has just been presented with divorce papers, but everyone is being very adult and civilised despite feelings running deep and there being family issues in the past which should have been addressed, but which have been deliberately ignored as being too painful. Oh, and a super-mega-monster earthquake hits California, stranding Emma in mortal danger in Los Angeles and Blake in mortal danger in San Francisco, but fortunately Ray pilots a rescue helicopter...Disaster movies offer the spectacle of disaster married to the soap operatics of the characters caught up in those disasters, and San Andreas does not buck the trend here – the family members played by Dwayne Johnson (Ray), Carla Gugino (Emma) and Alexandra Daddario (Blake) are all likable – certainly likable enough for the audience to be invested in them and want to see them emerge alive and well at the end. And Ioan Gruffudd has just a sniff of the slimeball about him from the start...And we certainly get value for money in the disaster stakes – the destruction of the Hoover Dam (see Superman), Los Angeles decimated (see 2012), San Francisco pounded to pieces (too many to mention, most recently Godzilla) and flooded by a tsunami (OK, I'll grant you that one). Much of it makes little sense – San Francisco is, I recollect, a bit on the hilly side, and I have doubts that the floodwater would be quite as extensive as it is portrayed here – and there's not an ounce of originality in it from start to finish, but all of it is brilliantly executed.Alexandra Daddario is extremely gifted in the T-shirt-filling department.This film is the exact definition of a popcorn movie – sit down with your popcorn, put your brain on hold, and enjoy.\",\n",

I had never heard about the movie prior to sitting down to watch it, so I wasn\\'t really sure on just what I was getting into.And having just sat through 91 minutes of \"Sheroes\", I have to say wow. Just wow! This movie, from writer and director Jordan Gertner was just a bitter pill to swallow. While the storyline started out adequately, and definitely seemed like a comedy, the movie just quickly took a turn and become an action movie. But it just didn\\'t feel right in any way, especially since the characters were so very unlikely action heroines. They went from partying young adults to suddenly becoming highly trained ladies capable of taking down a Thai drug cartel singlehandedly, something which several countries had been unsuccessful in doing. Yeah, that was very plausible and believable.The storyline in the movie just felt awkward, because I am sure that writer and director Jordan Gertner were fully serious about the plot, storyline, characters and the contents of the story.While I wasn\\'t familiar with the cast ensemble, I will say that the actresses and actors on the cast list actually performed adequately, despite of a very laughable script they had to work with.If you enjoy action movies, then perhaps you would get a kick out of watching \"Sheroes\", if you can get past the fact that the director was fully serious about what was transpiring on the screen. I managed to sit through the movie, and found some bizarre, odd entertainment to the ludicrous plot. However, this is not a movie that I will ever return to watch a second time.My rating of writer and director Jordan Gertner\\'s 2023 movie \"Sheroes\" lands on a four out of ten stars.',\n",

Here are some things I noted down as I was watching:This movie has the gall to reference James Bond when a character orders a martini shaken, not stirred. This movie has the gall to completely rip off mission impossible. They even steal a line from Spider-Man (see my headline above). And a character does the Black Widow pose from the Avengers.There is a scene where they\\'re watching some news footage of a man promoting a fight. Later, they go to see that man in person, and it\\'s the exact same footage/dialogue of him promoting the fight. Are you kidding me? You couldn\\'t film another 5 second scene with one actor?I\\'m never one to complain when a woman wins a fight against a bigger man. We\\'re watching a movie with imaginary characters. James Bond can beat up a guy three times his size. That\\'s his character, he\\'s THAT good. In Sheroes, on the other hand, it\\'s a fight between a \"skater girl\" and what amounts to a professional MMA fighter... Are you for realing me?By the end of this movie, these women are super spies... In a span of a few days... With their only training being target practice. WHO WROTE THIS?!?!?There is a CGI shot of a plane. It\\'s just flying, not an action scene. And it literally made me yell out, \"WHAT IS THAT?!?!?!\" It looks like a PS2 game. Vehicles are one of the easiest things to CGI. How is it this bad? And if it is, why would you even use that shot. It\\'s completely unnecessary.I can\\'t even do it. This is insanity. There is a scene where Diamond gets to the head cartel guy with her pistol pointed at him. He gets up and walks towards her like he\\'s not afraid. Then he sees a red dot on his chest and suddenly stops, looking very concerned. And they show Ezra with a sniper, \"I got him.\" I don\\'t understand. Is the pistol not enough? Is the guy immune to pistol bullets and his only weakness is sniper bullets?Then when he threatens to follow them home and kill them all, she shoots the two poisonous spider terrariums on the wall behind him. Then IMMEDIATELY in the next shot, he has two spiders on his face, looking like he\\'s dying. Did her bullets have a shockwave effect that launched the spiders out of the terrariums and onto his face, and caused them to be so startled that they instantaneously bit him????????Also, why wouldn\\'t she just shoot him? You know, so he doesn\\'t immediately come after you... EXACTLY like he does. Then Diamond throws the gun to Ryder instead of shooting the guy herself. I DON\\'T UNDERSTAND.Even the end credits song is hysterical.',\n",

Wallis Day (Ryder) played the part of the fighter, but was portrayed to look like Wallis Day in Charlie's Angels (2019), but that was in my opinion. Sasha Luss (Diamond) played the part well enough, but I couldn't take to her character. Skai Jackson (Daisy) was just the helpless love interest that needed to be rescued.With a relatively small budget (around $20 million), I think that the movie was done well enough. A bigger budget would have produced a much better experience, but it is what is. Some acting is rubbish and is definitely a B level performance. The writing, it's easy to see where some of the inspiration came from, just didn't have the budget to produce it for the screen.Don't expect big budget effects and polish, and you will probably enjoy it. I would recommend this.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'The basic economics of film making dictate that, in today\\'s market, there is more demand than supply. Creators can fill the void with overhyped overpriced nonsense (like F&F X) or they can set a more realistic target. And hit it. This is what used to be called a B movie meant to fill time with a colorful and distracting tale of 4 beautiful women who take a spur of the moment trip to Thailand and immediately get involved in some zany adventures involving goons and guns. It never promised to be more than that. And it delivers. It is technically perfect. Even the music fits. I can think of a dozen Netflix series I started and never finished because the production team just plain ran out of ideas halfway in. This film sets a target and hits it. Why the haters?

The film tells a story about four best friends whose one of them was captured only because she wanted to get high. Their rescue mission is so cliched with some references to action franchises like Taken, Mission: Impossible, Rambo and James Bond. Story is so flawed that i already expected what will happen to them and the bad Thai guys. The male actors in this film are so awful (except for Thai ones who might be grateful to work with some second tier actors).Sasha Luss, who hit a jackpot after starring a film with Cillian Murphy (one of the most talked actors of 2023 by the way) few years ago, suffered a massive downgrade after she managed to sleep with random-ass NPC who secretly has an allies in enforcement agency.

       "  'comment': \"The Darkest Minds is the latest teen sci-fi franchise alike Hunger Games, Divergent, Twilight, The Host etc etc etc and alike the majority of them will never be a fully told story.It tells the tale of a world where 90% of kids die leaving the remaining ones with a selection of super powers (For some unexplained reason). The government rounds them up and incarcerates them out of fear killing off the more powerful ones.It follows the tale of one girl who is smuggled out and goes on the run. But who can she trust?Personally I loved the concept, such potential! Under the circumstances a television series would have made a tremendous amount more sense as I think this is all we're ever going to see from the Darkest Minds universe.Our leading lady is fantastic, truly stellar performance and it wasn't until late in the film I realised it was Rue from the Hunger Games (2012) all grown up. Alongside her we have the excellent Bradley Whitford, Wade Williams, Mandy Moore and Game of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie (Though all of them are rather brief).One thing that struck me was the leading man Harris Dickinson, he just wasn't up to the job in any respect and felt like a weak link throughout. I can't imagine how he got the job and question castings logic with that one.The main issue with the movie is that it's the same as the rest. What I mean by that is these teen sci-fi types take a concept and then surround it by the usual tropes that are so blatant and so excessive it damages them beyond repair.\\nThis made the film cliched beyond words and criminally predictible.All things considered it could be worse but all the teen sci-fi tropes, the fact this is all we'll get and thus leaving us with an incomplete story and a weak leading man stopped any potential it had dead in its tracks.Great for what it is and I see the appeal, but this is to the movie industry what pop is to the music industry.The Good:Amandla StenbergDecent supporting castSome very good ideasHearts in the right placeThe Bad:Too many tropesVery clichedHarris DickinsonThings I Learnt From This Movie:Hollywood needs to go back to the drawing board on this genreA world without kids sounds like my kind of place\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Have not read the source material (have heard a lot of good things about it though), but did love the idea of the film, have nothing against dystopian books/films and there were watchable actors involved, love Gwendoline Christie in 'Game of Thrones' for example. Will admit about not being sure about seeing it, with not so good word of mouth from friends. Didn't see any critical reviews before watching, a deliberate decision, and without knowledge of it not being well received critically while seeing a lot of passionate defence. Seeing it for myself with an open mind, there are things wrong with 'The Darkest Minds' and it is not hard to find issues with it. There are also a fair share of good things, certainly did not think it was that bad and is nowhere near close to being one of the worst of the year. For me, 'The Darkest Minds' was a mixed bag and not an easy film to make of.Beginning with the good things, 'The Darkest Minds' looks great. It is very handsomely and imaginatively designed in setting, is beautifully shot, cohesively edited and the special effects are really quite good. Was also really impressed by the music score, which had such a beautiful grandeur, rousing energy and emotional sweep. The acting is not bad, above average in fact and very good even in the cases of Harris Dickinson and especially Amandla Stenberg. Their chemistry and performances have genuine heart, as does the whole thing about their gifts. Parts are fun, parts are imaginative and parts are emotional. However, 'The Darkest Minds' second half does feel on the rushed side, where explanations seemed half-baked and revealed too late when there was little time to go. Parts did feel under-explored and glossed over and the villain was like an afterthought. The dialogue can be very cringe-worthy too and of the characters only the two leads show signs of development, the rest being shallow clichés. Some of the cast are ill-used, Gwendoline Christie being one of the primary ones.Count me in as another person who found the ending far too abrupt and anti-climactic, another ending this year to be seemingly setting things up for a sequel (like 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom', 'Avengers: Infinity War' and 'Solo: A Star Wars Story') which is potentially dangerous in case plans for a sequel falls through. Am another person too who found the big plot twist far from a surprise and done in a way that was clunky and obvious. In summary, could have been better but not that bad. 5/10 Bethany Cox\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'This is not about politics.\\nIt\\'s about your children.\\nThis is about our children.\\nWe will find a cure and we\\'ll save our precious sons and daughters.If you want to form a sentence with the words \"monotony\", \"mediocrity\", \"clichéd sameness\" and \"corny\", you can do that without any problems along with the movie title \"The Darkest Minds\". Well, I\\'m getting sick of the concept of dystopian teen films. Even though they mixed it this time with a kind of \"X-men\" mood. Apart from some crackling electrical flashes, a storm with trees crashing down and flying containers, there\\'s not much more to see here. And don\\'t expect impressive special effects either.Actually, I already had the feeling while watching \"The 5th Wave\" that after the successful franchises of \"Divergent\" and \"The Hunger Games\" we would be flooded with weak duplicates of this genre for years. Duplicates of which they hoped it could be the start of again some successful sequels. However, I\\'m afraid this is yet again another feeble attempt that will fail. Simply because \"The Darkest Minds\" is really embarrassingly bad.This time it\\'s not a devastating war or an alien invasion that makes our planet a place where survival is priority number one. No, it\\'s a sudden emerging disease (Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration) that actually kills about 95% of young people. I suppose this is a kind of childhood disease of a higher level. And those who survive suddenly have supernatural powers.They are locked up straight away in youth camps by the adult world. Allegedly to examine them and to find a cure. Ultimately it\\'s because these adults, like with the X-men, are afraid of mutants and secondly because they are afraid to lose power. There, on the basis of their acquired powers, those kids are divided into groups. Each with a specific color, whereby those from the orange and red camp are considered to be the most dangerous. In other words, persons who\\'re allocated to these two groups, simply are going to be eliminated. Likewise, the lovely girl Ruby (Amandla Stenberg) who appears to be part of the orange team after being tested.For the umpteenth time, we see how moronic and stupid adults are portrayed in these kinds of films. Orange means that a person has the ability to manipulate someone else\\'s thoughts. You don\\'t need to be an Einstein to know how Ruby manages to save herself from this life-threatening situation. The moment Ruby escapes from this concentration camp and joins a group of teenagers, you can get ready for the most sugar-coated and predictable storyline ever.The group of teenagers, consisting of Liam (Harris Dickinson), Chubs (Skylan Brooks) and Zu (Miya Cech), are looking for a kind of youth camp where children are safe. It\\'s led by a legendary figure with the name \"The Slip Kid \". And before you know it, love is in the air and Ruby finds the ultimate hint to find out where the camp is located. And finally, there\\'s also a mandatory plot twist. Only viewers who have fallen asleep above their popcorn, haven\\'t seen that one coming. The only thing I could appreciate was the end. I can\\'t say it was really original. But it\\'s kind of daring. But I came real quick to my senses when I realized that sequels with similar nonsense are likely to be released in the future.To be honest, you can\\'t blame the film studios to release such films. After all, the profit is the most important thing for them. And when a specific genre is already a hype for a number of years, you have to continue with it until the subject has been completely milked dry. And as long as the theaters fill up with teenage girls (With helmets on because they run into walls while being constantly focused on their smartphones) who dream away while watching a film full of female heroism and who swoon when looking at a handsome Boyband-like wuss, the studios continue to produce these type of movies.Till one day when those youngster themselves exclaim in disgust (the age of reason probably) that they\\'ve had enough. And despite the political correctness in this film and the moral of equality (an \"It doesn\\'t matter what color you are\"-like message), it still remains mediocre crap with superheroes in it. So even though colors play an important role in \"The Darkest Minds\", it\\'s just a colorless (and also uninspired) teenage film.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'In an unspecified year in the future, 98% of American kids were wiped out by a mysterious disease called Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration (or IAAN). 10-year old Ruby Daly was one of the survivors. She and the other survivors of the plague were gathered up by the government and put them in a camp. There the kids were classified by color, based on the special ability that they possessed: Greens were geniuses. Blues were telepathics. Golds had electrical powers. Reds and Oranges were rare, but were considered dangerous and were terminated on site. Ruby was an Orange. She had to discover how to use her power in order to survive.When Ruby was able to escape from her camp, she met and made friends with a group of fellow runaways, namely Zu (a Yellow cutie), Chubbs (a Green nerd) and Liam (a Blue jock). Inevitably, a romance will bloom between Ruby and Liam, a common angle in these YA books. They eventually found and sought refuge in EDO, a camp for survivor kids. I went into this film not knowing that it was based on the first book of a young adult book series written by Alexandra Bracken. Her \"The Darkest Minds\" series started in 2012, and is now already into its fifth installment. When it came to the part about classifying the kids according to their abilities, \"Divergent\" immediately came to mind. That book series by Veronica Roth began in 2011. So these two were basically one in spirit, riding the same YA trend in the earlier part of this decade.However, the film version of \"Divergent\" came out in 2014, just about the same time when similar YA films like \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels, \"The Giver\" (2014) and \"The Maze Runner\" (2014) came out. That is the problem with \"The Darkest Minds,\" it came out at this time when this trend had already run out of steam. Even the sequels of \"Divergent\" and \"Maze Runner\" only did middling box office business when they were released more recently. Up and coming young actress Amandla Sternberg played Ruby. She has the star quality and screen presence seen in Jennifer Lawrence (as Katniss Everdeen) and Shailene Woodley (as Beatrice Prior). Sternberg began her career as young Cataleya in \"Columbiana\" (2011) and as Rue in \"The Hunger Games\" (2012). She had her first lead role last year in \"Everything, Everything,\" and now this. With the sensitive acting she showed here, it is not far-fetched that she will also earn critical acclaim in the future.Harris Dickinson played Liam Stewart. He was in the same mold as Theo James (as Four in \"Divergent\"), looking and acting a lot like him. Skylan Brooks and Miya Cech play her other friends Chubs and Suzume \"Zu\", respectively. Patrick Gibson played Clancy Gray, the son of the US President and a fellow Orange who took a special interest in Ruby. Former teen star Mandy Moore (from \"A Walk to Remember,\" 2002) is now 34 years old, and played Dr. Cate, a doctor from the resistance (Children\\'s League) who helped Ruby escape the camp. Bradley Whitford played US President Grey, a shadowy figurehead much like President Snow was in \"Hunger Games.\" \"Game of Thrones\" star Gwendoline Christie had a few scenes as Lady Jane, a bounty hunter chasing runaway kids.Watching \"The Darkest Minds\" gave me a \"been there, done that\" feeling. I could not help but see just another rehash of all the previous YA adventure series, and that was also reflected in this review. It did have its own twists, particularly regarding a certain power that only Ruby can perform, but it will take sequels to explore how this story will proceed from the familiar set-up it had begun with here. As of now though, we are still not sure if those sequels will come or not. 5/10.',\n",

Those who survive have various paranormal abilities, and are graded by the government from Green (the majority, with simple, safe powers) up through the colours to Orange (rare, and so dangerous that they are to be killed on identification). 10 year old Orange Ruby survives by pretending to be Green inside one of the the prison camps which house all children. When the authorities finally realise the truth, Ruby escapes and enters one of the underground factions.This film is an adaptation of the first of a Young Adult novel trilogy (yes, another one). As a result, there is no real ending. The story works moderately well as it goes along, but leaves you with a host of unanswered questions at the end. Maybe some of them are addressed in subsequent instalments, but the absence of answers here is pretty unsatisfying. The whole prison camp with sadistic guards scenario is difficult to swallow, for a start.The young cast work hard and do quite well. Amandla Stenberg is pneumatic, as she was in Everything, Everything, as Ruby, and pulls off a pleasingly emotional sequence towards the end.As a science fiction lover, I felt this had the potential to be better, though.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'I\\'m not even sure this is worth the review time.Not a single part of this movie is worth highlighting and even some of the worst of all time movies have at least something positive. Maybe when I calm down I can think of one. Wait...I got it. The actors WERE awake for their scenes and probably memorized most of their lines. Okay, bravo cast!I\\'m aware of the teeny-bopper film series Hollywood likes to make and most of them have been pretty pathetic - not to mention sometimes left incomplete: The Host and Divergent, to name a couple. Can\\'t say much for The Maze Runner or The Hunger Games since I never made it past the first one of each franchise. And this will be the same: only one crappy TDM chapter for me.This soulless film had zero heart put into it, the characters were bland, uninteresting and contained zero chemistry with each other and even the comic relief was a pain to watch. In fact, it wasn\\'t until 3 or 4 unfunny \"jokes\" that I figured he was supposed to be the comic relief. Overall, the production felt lost and without a director at all.Apparently, the grand majority of kids mysteriously die off and the remaining ones are sent off to camps because the government fears them. Hmmm, boy that sounds familiar. Perhaps it\\'s too soon to make a movie about the U.S. Government separating families from their kids and putting them into camps against everyone\\'s will.I digress. One kid escapes and faces multiple options of factions. In almost every other scene, she threatens to leave one for another, so get used to that redundancy. Eventually, they meet more clichés, predictable characters and twists and then the movie anticlimactically and abruptly asks you to wait for a part 2 of 4(?) I guess. Actually, my guess: there won\\'t be another of these unless it can be made as cheaply as this one was for. My bet: $5 million MAX.The acting sucked, the dialogue was cringeworthy, the special effects looked worse than a Sharknado entry and ideas were literally stolen from the similar X-men series. Hell, it was even produced by the same company.Okay, I thought of one more positive. The previously aforementioned film, The Host, was definitely inferior to this, but that\\'s just because it had an annoying girl\\'s voiceover throughout. This, alas, didn\\'t have that one worse quality.Totally skip this and pray to GOD they fail to make any follow-ups.***Final thoughts: Okay, perhaps this might be an unintentionally hilarious movie to watch at home with a group of drunk friends. Despite this movie being completely void of any real humor and DEADLY serious, I can see myself having fun with several great drinking games due to its repetitiveness and scenes/ideas lifted from slightly better teeny-bopper films.',\n",

However, I feel that while the book and film are different in many ways (as they have to be, as there are things in the novel that can\\'t be done easily on screen), the production team did a wonderful job of making the film their own, but sticking to the novel very well. Although it seemed fast paced at times, I was eager to see what would happen next.

I had the incredible opportunity to be a background extra on the set of the film, and saw firsthand how hard both the cast and crew worked to bring this film to life.

Ruby Daly managed to survive despite being powerful. It's six years later. Ruby is uncovered and Cate (Mandy Moore) helps her escape. Cate is a part of the League which is using the kids to fight the government. Ruby runs away and ends up with fellow kids with powers; Zu, Liam Stewart, and Chubs.This seems to have been written by a high school student. It's silly to think that a dictatorial government would have any trouble finding a well marked van driving across a desolate country. It's silly to think that people would have a difficult time finding a spot on the radio dial. It makes the kids look stupid when they don't see the obvious traps. One has to overlook a lot. It's a sci-fi YA fantasy high school melodrama. Any actual drama is mostly accidental. The twist is foreseeable although the villain is a good turn. I actually like the villain but he is conveniently dumb at times. I do like the four kids on the road. I like the quartet. The rest falls flat.\",\n",

Each comes away with a different set of \"gifts.\" They were such things as being able to telekinetically move large objects, or to touch someone and be able to read their mind. Or touch someone and change their will, to make them do exactly what they wanted them to do.The government is afraid of what they might do and systematically are capturing and imprisoning them. Some are to be killed. One of them, Amandla Stenberg as Ruby Daly, is particularly bright and dangerous, but manages to escape. As do many others.It is all science fiction, of course, and while the story has some unique aspects to it the general theme has been done in a number of different approaches.

Super smart kids' eyes turn green, telekenesis kids blue, electricity manipulating kids yellow, fire breathing kids red, and mind manipulation kids orange. The government and other factions quickly take these kids to take them to be soldiers. But the red and orange kids are too dangerous and so they are largely killed.Ruby Daly (Amandla Stenberg) is an orange who escapes with the help of a doctor friend, Cate, who turns out to work for the League (which isn't clearly explained, but is hinted at that they're trying to build an army of their own). She then leaves her to join a bunch of other kids: Chubs, Zu, and Liam. Ruby and Liam start to form a relationship as the four look for the promised land of other kids who have powers but learn to live in peace and harmony.But the promised land isn't a promised land and the leader, son of the president who everyone thought was cured and turned out not to be also turns out to be a bad guy building his army.The four kids escape, but Chubs is hurt and can only be saved with the help of Cate, and the League. She does it anyway. She begs Liam to leave as they'd want to capture him for his past history with them, but he won't leave her because the two have fallen in love. Knowing this, she wipes all the memories they share so that Liam feels no need to stay. Then she takes her spot as, I guess, some sort of leader of the League.This is a pretty decent movie that's been done before in different ways. It's a teen dystopian future with a love story. Nothing really that special, plot wise. Sure, interesting concept, but they didn't get to do much with it. There are also too many questions that I assume get answered in the books, but I doubt this movie will see any sequels, so you're left with too many holes knowing they won't be answered in the movies. The twist and turns are pretty much expected. Ruby wiping Liam's memory was a shock to me, but I suppose not too surprising in hindsight (she did the same with her parents) and was pretty obviously set up that the two would meet again.The one bright spot in the movie was Amandla Stenberg as Ruby. She was great and I hope to see more of her in future movies.6/10. It's a meh with no movie-closure, but Amandla Stenberg redeems it a bit.\",\n",

This movie repeats everything but adding more on top which extends the runtime to over 2 hours and that's not helping at all. I bet most kids who have seen the original will likely get bored by the end. None of the added scenes are good - the songs are so cringy I can't believe someone gave the green light to include them in the movie. I liked the original songs. The re-design of Sebastian wasn't to my taste at all. The cartoon crab was so much more entertaining. The bird changed from being a bit awkward in the original to annoying and quite irritating in this one. That scuddlebutt song was the lowest point of the whole movie.Of course, there were good changes which made a litlte more sense compared to the original. I liked how the relationship between Ariel and Eric progressed more naturally. I liked all actors and the effort they put in this movie. Everyone did their best with what was given to them even though with so much blue screen there wasn't much space to really shine.Overall, it was a decent movie, but rather uncalled for. It was done just because they could do it. Even the effects weren't as good. I can tell this won't age well in 20 years.\",\n",

The biggest issue straight out of the gate is that much like pretty much all these live action remakes is that it didn't need to be made. If I want to watch any of the films that have been re made then 9 times out of 10 I'm going to watch the original animation, they're just classics with heart that can't be re created in live action. That being said this film exists and I have limitless so may as well watch it.Another big issue I had with this film is the pacing, it's a 2hrs 15 mins kids film and with the attention span that kids have today even if it was well paced kids would be bored by the end. This film to me felt like it had a lot of filler particularly once (spoiler) Arial gets her legs in the second act and none of it was that interesting. For me the film didn't add anything that would have made the animation better if it had been in there. That being said this film isn't a total loss, Halle Bailey (not Halle Berry 🐱) is great as arial, when she hits the high note in part of your world I couldn't help but be amazed. In fact that song was probably the stand out scene of the film for me, it was brilliantly recreated.Bailey is also forced to convey the emotion of her character for a large part of the film just with her eyes and she does a great job of it. I also felt Melisa McCarthy was great as Ursula although I felt her character was underused in what was ultimately an anti-climatic final act. I do want to give a special to mention to Javier Bardem as he gives probably the flattest performance of his entire career as a King Triton. I genuinely got the impression from his performance that he didn't really want to be in this film and to be honest I can't blame him as much like his performance the film feels largely flat for the most part.\",\n",

It falls flat in almost every aspect, leaving me feeling underwhelmed and disconnected, unlike the original.Halle Bailey as Ariel was good and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was passable but beside those two, all of the other characters felt virtually nonexistent with zero chemistry with one another.Visually, the remake falls short in creating a believable underwater world. The CGI effects were uninspiring and more importantly, looked cheap.What 'The Little Mermaid' suffered from the most was the god awful script. The pacing was uneven, scenes dragged on or failed to contribute to the overall narrative, and the characters felt shallow and lacked depth.Overall, the 2023 remake was lackluster and forgettable. The uninspiring performances, poor visual effects, and terrible original songs left me disengaged and disappointed. Don't let the positive reviews the film has been receiving gaslight you into thinking that these awful cash grab live-action remakes that Disney has been producing are okay. The truth is the film fails to capture the magic and charm that made the original film so beloved, which is on par with all the other Disney remakes.\",\n",

The ocean is all horrible cgi hair and crazy psychedelic colors but it feels like a proper universe. On the other hand the human world is insanely cheap looking, a green screen studio Bridgerton with questionable colonial undertones. The market scene is appalling, so shiny and weirdly modern looking as if you were in a themed tourist trap. The studio lighting makes all the actors look like soap opera extras. I feel so bad for the Eric actor who had to deliver that embarrassing solo that reaches the highest levels of camp. And the edit is so stiff, the acting so stilted it seems the director was inspired by Gone With the Wind.So sure there are some so-bad-it's-good campy moments like the mermaids group looking like a doll display in a kid's bedroom, or the OTT actress playing human Ursula. But oh boy Javier Bardem looks like an AI gone wrong. His out of the water shots had the whole cinema laughing as you could just imagine him shooting them in a tiny pool trying to look serious with that hobo beard and cheesy shell outfit.At least Halle/Ariel delivered and Ursula was just what you expected from one of the best Disney villains. I wish the climax was a bit longer because those visuals were stunning.This new remake won't age well at all as all those unapologetically mediocre cash grabs.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"The Little Mermaid (2023) is a movie that my daughter and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a mermaid princess obsessed with the surface and humans. When a Prince's boat crashes and she saves him she becomes even more obsessed with him and the ways of humans against her father's advice. She makes a deal with a sea witch to become human for three days but if the prince doesn't kiss her in that time, she will return to the ocean to be the witch's slave forever. Can the mermaid uncover the ways of the humans and find true love?This movie is directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago) and stars Halle Bailey (Last Holiday), Jonah Hauer-King (A Dog's Way Home), Melissa McCarthy (The Heat), Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Man), Noma Dumezweni (Dirty Pretty Things) and Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians).This live action remake is beautifully executed with tremendous CGI, storytelling and use of color. Seeing this in 3D was a treat too. The storyline aligned to this animated film perfectly with some good additions. I loved the depiction of the island life and struggles of the humans and mermaids and their mutual perception of each other. I did miss the cook from the cartoon. The new songs were hit or miss. I can't say I enjoyed Eric's song, Halle's new songs worked and I actually enjoyed the rap. The back and forth between Sebastian and Scuttle was hilarious and well written. Melissa McCarthy was a fantastic Ursula and how she was depicted was perfect, especially at the very end.Overall, this is one of the best Disney live action remakes. I would score this a strong 8-8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.\",\n",

Flounder look hideous, I have no idea what they were thinking. Straight up CGI fish and crab.Songs are bad. Halle Bailey has great voice, and can sing, but other than that, the songs are terrible. A lot of times actors singing go out of tune or lose rythm mostly because the line doesn't really fit the music.Scuttlebutt song made my ears bleed, I also wanted to scratch my eyes out and this scene just wouldn't end.Visuals are good, but everything is washed out and dark that you can't really appreciate the CGI which is surprisingly good for an disney movie.Some things are taken straight from the original and some are changed to make more sense because they wanted this movie to have more diverse cast, and at least these changes are made to make it fit.But still it's not as good as the original, some new things added don't recompensate the things that were cut out.Had like 4 laughs, but nothing to write home about.Could've been better.\",\n",

I was ready to be whisked away to a magical underwater world with filmmaker Rob Marshall\\'s highly anticipated live-action retelling of this classic Disney movie. My grandkids were excited to see the remake of their favorite \"Little Mermaid\" movie but became bored after 20-minutes after the movie started. The movie was unusually dark and foreboding and unsuited for a younger audience in my humble opinion.Not sure I like the trend to make poorly written remakes of classic, beloved movies. I will have to rethink going to future Disney and Pixar movies since the characters were unappealing and plot dragging on.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"My Review - The Little Mermaid\\nMy Rating- 9/10At long last a Disney live action feature film reimagining of a much loved previous animated Disney classic that's not a dud like the recent Pinocchio and Dumbo .The Little Mermaid is a triumph for Director Rob Marshall who's previous film treatments of musicals like Chicago 2002 Into The Woods 2014 and Disney's Mary Poppins Returns 2018 I've completely forgiven him for his treatment of Nine in 2005.All the cast in The Little Mermaid shines like the beam from a Lighthouse but the shining star in my view is Halle Bailey as Ariel the mermaid who longs to experience what life is like on land with the Prince she rescues from drowning.Halle Bailey's debut in this estimated $200million musical feature movie is inspired as she is a relatively little known star name but I'm confident that this movie will change that .Halle's casting and performance in The Little Mermaid reminded me of two other examples of relatively little known actresses who were perfectly cast in their roles they are two Marias's Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music and more recently Rachel Zegler in West Side Story.The original score by composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman with much-loved composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman plus four new songs, with lyrics by Hamilton composer Lin - Manuel Miranda all add to the spectacle .My favourites are the three great numbers Part of Your World sung beautifully by Halle Bailey ,Poor Unfortunate Souls with additional lyrics by Lin - Manuel Miranda sung and performed with devilish delight by Melissa McCarthy .Of course the great production number Under The Sea earns a screen credit for the famous Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation who came on board to assist Rob Marshall it truly is a triumph of live action and stunning animation.The rest of the featured cast includes Jonah Hauer-King as the handsome Prince Eric who impresses Ariel enough to rescue him and save his life . Lin -Manuel Miranda's new song for him to sing Wild Uncharted Waters fits into the plot beautifully and is well sung.The two well known box office stars are Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the Sea Witch enchantress who bewitches Ariel stealing her voice but granting her legs to enter the human world. Special mention must be made at this point to praise the superb costumes worn by Ursula, all the mermaids ,King Triton and all the human cast members of The Little Mermaid that are beautifully designed by Colleen Atwood a four time Oscar Winner.Ariel has only 3 sunsets to win the love of Prince Eric with a kiss or return to the sea and become her slave .Javier Bardem is commanding in his role as King Triton Ariel's kind but strict father who's sister Ursula wants to crush him in revenge for her banishment with her tentacles.I found the CGI special effects very impressive perhaps a little dark in parts but equal to anything I've seen recently.This updated version depicts Ariel in a much more contemporary way her whole interest is not merely romantic this version shows the heroine as an independent young woman who rejects the suspicion and resentment of the human world that her protective father expresses to keep her from leaving her safe home under the sea .There's all the fun still in this movie from Ariel's sea friends Scuttle the seagull ,Sebastian the Jamaican crab and flounder .Much of the outdoor Film location took place on Santa Teresa di Gallura on Sardinia's northern coast.This is a movie I think for all audiences young and older perhaps a little scary for very young children as it has some dark scary moments .I loved The Little Mermaid please see it in its Cinema release don't wait till September or October when it will be streamed by Disney Plus.\",\n",

It was not as bad as I thought it would be and I thought the girl that played Ariel was really good. Surprisingly, Melissa McCarthy was pretty good as Ursula. But, the dude who plays Prince Eric sucked. I mean his acting wasn't bad and he kind of looked like the cartoon guy, but his song hurt, it felt like I was listening to an 8-track of Ben Stein singing the hits of Mariah Carey in my grandfather's old Mercedes. And the bird, I am not sure who thought it was a good idea to have that abomination rap/sing but there have been better rappers in after school specials and D. A. R. E videos. What could have fixed all of this is having the world's greatest thespian play all the roles except Ariel, Ursula, and the Queen, Billy Zane could have single handedly saved the whole movie. I fell asleep right after the whole Ursula on the patio part and didn't wake up until they were getting ready to leave, so I am not sure how it actually ends, but my daughters liked it, so it must be appealing to young girls who think ketchup is a main course.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'SCORE: 10/10My heart is so full right now. After all the backlash and criticism this film received before it had even come out, it delivered one of the best live action remakes that has ever been put to screen. As I was watching, it became more and more clear what the task at hand was for the people that made this movie, and how they over delivered in virtually every aspect possible. The animated version was amazing, but there is something that animation allows you to do with the storytelling and character development that just wouldn\\'t make sense in live action. All of this talk about how \"awful\" Sebastian and Flounder looked compared to the animation doesn\\'t matter because it just works, so much to the point where I actually enjoy this version a lot more.This version of The Little Mermaid takes all the awesome moments, dialogue, and songs from the original and adds a modern flavor to it. Even the new songs were great, with the Scuttle song in the style of Lin-Manuel Miranda being a nice, entertaining surprise. The pacing was perfect and it knew exactly how much time to spend on each part of the story, not overextending at all. It understands comedic timing so well, and the casting choices for Ursula and Sebastian were genius. This version of Sebastian was top tier and Melissa McCarthy brings her all. Kiss the Girl is one of my favorite Disney songs ever and I was dying with laughter watching Sebastian sing from under the hat. Gosh I just loved everything about this movie. Jonah Hauer-King is a wonderful Eric and complements the performance given by the woman who deserves the world.This last paragraph is dedicated to Halle Bailey. What a beautiful, talented, special human being. Her portrayal of Ariel is what really drives this entire movie and her voice is so amazing. I don\\'t care if this is taken as a hot take, but she should totally be up for an Oscar for her performance. It takes so much courage to understand the backlash she would receive for the closed minded, bigoted people that inhabit this earth and deliver an unbelievable performance like she did. It wasn\\'t just what she did with her voice, but how she was able to enhance the story during her scenes where she couldn\\'t use her voice. A true superstar that needs to be protected at all costs.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"The Little Mermaid (2023) is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1989 animated classic, which was loosely based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The movie follows the story of Ariel, a curious and adventurous mermaid who falls in love with Prince Eric, a human she rescues from a shipwreck. To be with him, she makes a deal with Ursula, a wicked sea witch who takes her voice in exchange for human legs. Ariel must win Eric's heart before the time runs out, or else she will lose her soul to Ursula.The movie is directed by Rob Marshall, who has previously helmed musicals such as Chicago, Into the Woods and Mary Poppins Returns. The screenplay is written by David Magee, who also worked on Finding Neverland and Life of Pi. The music is composed by Alan Menken, who returns to score the film and write new songs with Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of Hamilton and Moana.The cast of the movie features newcomers and veterans alike. Halle Bailey stars as Ariel, making her feature film debut after being discovered by Beyoncé and appearing in the musical duo Chloe x Halle. Jonah Hauer-King plays Prince Eric, a British actor who has appeared in TV shows such as Little Women and World on Fire. Melissa McCarthy portrays Ursula, the iconic villainess who has a penchant for collecting souls and singing showstoppers. Javier Bardem plays King Triton, Ariel's father and the ruler of the underwater kingdom of Atlantica. Daveed Diggs, Awkwafina and Jacob Tremblay lend their voices to Sebastian, Scuttle and Flounder, Ariel's loyal friends and sidekicks. Noma Dumezweni plays Queen Selina, Eric's mother and a new character created for the film.The movie aims to modernize the classic tale for a new generation of audiences, while staying faithful to the spirit of the original. The movie features new scenes and characters that explore the cultures and backgrounds of Ariel and Eric, as well as their relationship and motivations. The movie also updates some of the songs and dialogue to reflect more contemporary sensibilities and humor.The movie is a feast for the eyes and ears, with stunning visuals and catchy tunes that will enchant viewers of all ages. The movie showcases the beauty and diversity of the ocean world, as well as the charm and splendor of the human realm. The movie also boasts impressive performances from the cast, especially Bailey, who brings a fresh and captivating take on Ariel. She sings with grace and power, expressing Ariel's longing and joy with every note. McCarthy also delivers a memorable turn as Ursula, who is both menacing and hilarious in her schemes and songs.However, the movie is not without its flaws. Some of the changes made to the story may not sit well with fans of the original animation or the fairy tale source material. Some of the new scenes and characters feel unnecessary or underdeveloped, while some of the old ones are altered or omitted for no apparent reason. The movie also suffers from some uneven pacing and editing, as well as some questionable choices in cinematography and visual effects. Some of the creature designs are also less than appealing or realistic, especially compared to other recent Disney live-action remakes.The Little Mermaid (2023) is a fun and entertaining musical fantasy that pays homage to its beloved predecessor while adding some new twists and flavors. It may not be perfect or groundbreaking, but it is a worthy addition to Disney's live-action canon that will surely delight fans old and new.\",\n",

Have the animators even visited a coral reef before? Or are they just trying to hide imperfect CGI by just turning down the color and brightness? Perhaps they should watch Avatar 2 to see how to do a live action amazing underwater world right. The live action aspect actively hurts the film due to making the non-human characters unexpressive at best, uncanny valley at worst.The run time is bloated, and although they have added some extra things in to fill the time, you kind of wish on the whole that they didn't. The rap song is particularly awful and doesn't feel like it fits at all with the rest of the music in the film.Like many that have gone before, there's no particular reason for this live action remake to exist apart from being nostalgia bait. Give it a miss and watch the original instead. It's cheaper to watch and a much better movie.\",\n",

I have never walked out of a movie before, but this one tempted me to leave multiple times.People were checking their phones. Children were talking and wandering around the theatre. What else do you need to know that this movie was downright boring?There's no excuse for such sloppy movies. And yet here we are, once again, with another boring remake.

       "  'comment': \"The underwater adventure presents a captivating visual spectacle infused with the melodious talents of Ms. Ariel, portrayed by Halle Bailey. The live-action adaptation of The Little Mermaid is a stunning production that impeccably captures the essence of the characters while incorporating a touch of uniqueness.The initial scenes build up anticipation as every character is introduced, except for our beloved Ariel. The film skillfully incorporates Halle Bailey's enchanting voice in the background, staying true to the allure of the mermaid's siren song. Halle Bailey shines brilliantly, much like the sun reflecting on the ocean, with her gentle interpretation of the character. A delightful PG love story unfolds between Ariel and the Prince, one that is sure to captivate audiences.Although Sebastian and Flounder appear more realistic than anything else in the film, the voice actors are well-cast, and Sebastian, in particular, brings a comical appeal to the story. The movie strikes a balance with ample drama and effectively utilizes music, ensuring that it feels like a complete cinematic experience rather than solely a musical. The songs are delightful and showcase the vocal range of the singers, including Ariel.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, appreciating its diverse elements. Halle's portrayal of Ariel and her captivating appearance was genuinely stunning. It's a delightful experience for both the younger audience and families, as well as those who cherish a well-crafted Disney movie. I would give The Little Mermaid a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.\",\n",

However, during the film I nearly feel asleep half way through as did the other guests who attended with me. Not to say that this is a bad movie, it just doesn't hold as much magic as the original does and it is not nearly as captivating. It felt that the new elements and songs that were added took up a lot of time and then the parts that I was waiting for felt rushed. For instance, Vanessa's arrival and the ceremony that follows felt like they lasted only 5 minutes and there was no big pay off and I felt the same with Ursula's final scene.I thought that Hallie and Melissa did a good job. I believe my favorite characters were the side characters such as Flounder, Sebastian, and even Scuttle (they should think about removing the rap from the DVD).Maybe that's an impossible expectation to compare it the original? Seeing as I personally feel that non of the Disney remakes have added any substance or reason for needing a remake.

This is in stark contrast to when they are watching the original at home as they will laugh and sing along. My wife was staring at her phone and I almost fell asleep.\",\n",

Watch this in a dolby theater if you can!The premise of the little mermaid is a simple one, and if you watch disney\\'s 1989 animated version today, you\\'ll see that they leaned really reallyyyy heavily into fairytale tropes... the most obvious one being they myth that a fleeting, superficial attraction = true love.I loved this 2023 remake of the little mermaid bc it strengthens this central theme of the story. Ariel doesn\\'t fall in love w eric bc he\\'s a hot prince. This film makes a point to develop eric\\'s character, to present eric and ariel as complex characters: two young, brave people on the precipice of life w helicopter parents who keep thwarting their plans for adventure. Every character in this film is very well developed, even their parents.Some of y\\'all just hate live action remakes, and you should just say that. We get it, animation is fun... you miss seeing magical animals w big disney eyes-it\\'s what makes these fairytale/kids movies instant classics. But live action gives actors, animators, AND visual effects artists the range to reimagine iconic films for a new audience. I\\'m not a huge \"live action remake\" fan, but this one blows every other out out the water- PUN INTENDED :)',\n",

Disney made a half-live action/half-CGI remake of the film that launched their Great Renaissance in the late Eighties/Early Nineties. And it was just as I feared.It was more lackluster than blockbuster.Javier Bardem was suitably convincing as the temperamental King Triton. And Hallie Bailey (which, to be honest, sounds more like a stage name hodge-podged from Halle Berry and Pearl Bailey ) was suitably charming as Ariel. Although, only with the spoken dialogue. Because her rendition of the songs sounded more like she was lip-synching to the Jodi Benson originals. Just as Melissa McCarthy sounded more like she was lip-synching to Pat Carroll\\'s songs as the original Ursula!Then there were the needless attempts at character \"development.\" Like making Ursula and Triton estranged siblings; or making Prince Eric an adopted son. What was even the point of the latter? Because all that made me do is think: \"Are Ariel and Eric going to be ret-conned as long-lost twins?!\"The only reasons I don\\'t give this just one star? The quaint charm of the two new songs...and the Hitchcockian cameo by Jodi Benson (the once-and-future voice of Princess Ariel).',\n",

       "  'comment': 'The Little Mermaid is a good example of what\\'s wrong with Disney these days (at least in my opinion) - besides some casting choices that may rise pro and contra voices (I don\\'t care), this movie is dead like plastic. The songs are stale and uninspired, the special effects department did okay, the actors did okay, but well, the formula of Disney movies is now a walking dead corpse, too many times chewed on. But this is not only a question of modern changes to fit to the taste of zeitgeist but for a long time Disney is like a recycling factory: with every turn of the machine the product gets worse and worse, at least if you don\\'t add something new, fresh and substantial, something creative. So my greatest complain: the music is average, the visuals are average, the story is the typical Disney blabla, the entertaining factor is rather low. A typical movie made from the construction kit branded \"Disney\". But maybe I\\'m just getting old and grumpy and my by age weakened eyes and heart cannot see the beauty in this, well, product.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"This mesmerizing live-action musical, starring the talented Halle Bailey, is an absolute triumph! The Little Mermaid showcases the beloved tale in a fresh and captivating way, with stunning visuals that bring the underwater world to life. The CGI is seamless, creating a truly immersive experience that surpassed my expectations.In this adaptation of The Little Mermaid, we follow the enchanting journey of Ariel (Halle Bailey), a young mermaid who longs to explore the human world. The film stays true to the heart of the original story, emphasizing themes of self-discovery, love and the importance of staying true to oneself.The Little Mermaid delivers exceptional performances, breathtaking visuals, and captivating storytelling. Halle Bailey performs remarkably, capturing Ariel's curiosity, spirit, and powerful voice. Casting a Black actress in the iconic role of Ariel is a decisive step toward diversifying the portrayal of princesses on screen. It offers young audiences, particularly Black girls who have rarely seen themselves in mainstream media, a chance to see a character they can deeply identify with, and I love that! The cast is rounded out with renowned actors who bring depth and charm to their respective roles. Tony winner Daveed Diggs gives a comedic, clever and heartfelt performance as Sebastian the Crab. Awkwafina's delightful portrayal of Scuttle the Seagull and Jonah Hauer-King's as Prince Eric brilliantly captures the original characters' essence while bringing their unique charm and charisma to the roles. They skillfully breathe new life into these beloved characters, adding depth and memorable moments that both longtime fans and new audiences will appreciate. The costumes, designed by Colleen Atwood, beautifully capture the underwater kingdom and the human world above. The music score by the talented duo of Oscar winner Alan Menken and Tony winner Lin-Manuel Miranda is magical, seamlessly blending Menken's enchanting melodies with Miranda's vibrant and rhythmic compositions, resulting in an unforgettable and captivating musical experience.The Little Mermaid carries a powerful message of self-acceptance, courage and pursuing one's dreams. It promotes positive social behavior and portrays relationships built on understanding and empathy.I give The Little Mermaid 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, plus adults. It releases in theaters on May 26, 2023. Immerse yourself in the enchanting world of Ariel and embark on a magical adventure! By Hanadie K., KIDS FIRST!\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"I'll start with this, Halle Bailey was fantastic. She was cast perfectly as Ariel with her tender voice and childlike charm. I think the entire cast did well given what they had to work with. My issue is that in most cases I feel these live action remakes are not able to capture the essence of their original counterparts. Little Mermaid is no exception, it was fun and colorful to watch but again I felt like something was missing. By the second half of the film I was counting down the time I'd be able to get to my bed. The film just never connected with me. And I almost feel like I would have been perfectly fine without this remake.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Within the Disney Renaissance, one of the most notable films is The Little Mermaid, which stands out for its magnificent composition primarily by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. They undertook meticulous work that transports the audience from the movie theater into an underwater world, where the harmonies, combined with the visual aspects, create an explosion of emotions in the viewers.Following this success, we find ourselves more than 30 years later with a version that attempts to faithfully recall its predecessor, but it has a limitation, it lacks the elements that only animation can provide.Starting with the songs, which are the pillars of this story, \"Part of Your World\" is, in my opinion, the most remarkable and perhaps the only one that truly tugs at the nostalgic strings on which the movie relies. Halle Bailey\\'s vocal performance, especially in this song, is nothing less than what was expected, a great start to the rest of the songs that maintain the essence of Ariel\\'s desire to explore the world she doesn\\'t belong to.On the other hand, we have what I consider a disaster with \"Under the Sea\", despite having Daveed Diggs portraying Sebastian, a musical theater actor with an ample musical experience, he is constrained within one of the worst character designs this film could have. The visual setting lacks color, appearing entirely gray and soulless, where Sebastian fails to stand out until the last 10 seconds at the ending, where poorly placed streamers at least add a bit of color.Melissa McCarthy delivers a rather average version of Ursula, with nothing particularly wrong, but also nothing noteworthy. Overall, her character seems even darker than in the 1989 version, but the script fails to give her the depth despite providing her with two extra scenes. As a result, viewers don\\'t perceive her as an imposing villain who instills fear.One of my biggest disappointments was Prince Eric, portrayed by Jonah Hauer-King. His solo song, \"Wild Uncharted Waters,\" which seemed to me as mediocre, considering it was written and produced not only by Alan Menken but also with the involvement of Lin-Manuel Miranda. I not only expected a more daring staging, but the lyrics themselves are very poor and superficial. They fail to make the character connect with the audience or provide any development or backstory before the events in the film. I\\'d like to compare this song to \"Evermore,\" also written by Alan Menken and Tim Rice, from the 2017 adaptation of \"Beauty and the Beast\" it serves as a great example of what a co-protagonist\\'s song should encompass to truly contribute value to their development and the film itself.In general, regarding the plot, I believe this adaptation attempts to bring a different touch, which succeeds in creating a fresh atmosphere. However, its development falls short, leaving gaps in the story. For example, the relationship between Ariel and king Triton, portrayed by Javier Bardem, lacks sufficient script development, limited to four dialogues and two brief scenes. The mermaid sisters seem more like an excuse to justify ethnic diversity rather than contributing to the plot. As mentioned earlier, Eric\\'s development is lacking, failing to establish a connection with his family or his people. Considering he is a prince, there is no demonstration of interest in his people beyond exploring the sea without any additional drive. Halle Bailey\\'s vocal work is truly excellent; however, it is not enough to convince that she is the only girl who could have portrayed the character.The most remarkable aspect of the film is that, surprisingly, there is a development of the romantic relationship between Ariel and the prince. Some modified details to give Ariel more prominence were well-executed. Additionally, the dog that appears provides a breath of fresh air compared to the other animals that are difficult to appreciate.Pd: I was really happy when I saw Jodi Benson\\'s cameo.',\n",
